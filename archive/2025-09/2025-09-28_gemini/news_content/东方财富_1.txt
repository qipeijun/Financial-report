The article reports on new regulations in Shanghai's housing market, effective September 26th, aimed at enhancing residential quality. The key highlight is a significant adjustment to how balcony areas are calculated for容积率 (floor area ratio) purposes, responding to market demand for more spacious balconies.

**Key changes in balcony area calculation:**

*   **New Rule:** Balconies (including enclosed ones) will have 1/2 of their horizontal projection area counted towards容积率 if they meet these conditions:
    *   Total horizontal projection area per household is no more than 10% of the unit's architectural area, and not exceeding 16 square meters (for units under 80 sqm, the limit is 8 sqm).
    *   The design depth of each balcony (maximum vertical distance from the outer edge of the balcony enclosure to the exterior wall) does not exceed 1.8 meters.
*   **Comparison to Old Rule:** Previously, balconies were counted at 50% if their area didn't exceed 8 square meters and depth was no more than 1.8 meters. The new "proportion + threshold" approach allows for larger balconies to be partially excluded from容积率. For example, a 140 sqm unit can now have a balcony up to 14 sqm (instead of 8 sqm), with 7 sqm effectively "free" (compared to 4 sqm previously).
*   **Additional Incentive:** Open balconies with enclosures, designed with a depth not exceeding 0.75 meters, located along public green spaces, plazas, rivers, or scenic streets, will not be counted towards容积率, saleable area, or the 10% balcony area limit. This provides an extra incentive for properties with scenic views.

**Other notable changes:**

*   **Exterior Facades:** High-quality exterior facade materials (like dry-hung stone, metal, terracotta panels) will not be counted towards容积率 if their decorative layer area is clearly defined in measurement reports. This encourages developers to use premium materials.
*   **Elevated Floors/Corridors:** Elevated floors and sheltered corridors used for public purposes (passageways, landscaping, resident leisure facilities) in multi-story residential buildings will not be counted towards容积率. This aims to enrich building forms and overall community environment.

These regulations are seen as a benefit for homebuyers, offering more comfortable living spaces, and encourage developers to improve product quality and design innovation.
