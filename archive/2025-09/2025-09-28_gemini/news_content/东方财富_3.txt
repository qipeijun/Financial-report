The article "Cost reduction, demand increase, new energy storage industry ushers in a golden development period" from CCTV Finance, dated September 28, 2025, highlights the rapid growth and promising future of China's new energy storage sector.

Key points:
*   **Policy Support:** The National Development and Reform Commission and National Energy Administration released an "Action Plan for Large-scale Construction of New Energy Storage."
*   **Ambitious Targets:** By 2027, China's new energy storage installed capacity is projected to exceed 180 million kilowatts, driving approximately 250 billion yuan in new project investment.
*   **Market Boom:** The industry is experiencing a "golden development period" with companies operating at full capacity, and orders for key components like battery cells extending into early next year. Stock prices of many storage companies have reached new highs.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Energy storage system costs have decreased by about 80% compared to three years ago, with new generation cells expected to further reduce costs by 40%.
*   **Diversified Revenue:** New policies encourage energy storage to participate in the electricity market, allowing storage stations to generate revenue through multiple channels like capacity leasing, market trading, and capacity compensation, ensuring reasonable returns on investment.
*   **Raw Material Stability:** While lithium carbonate prices saw fluctuations, they are currently stable, and the long-term outlook suggests a return to a balanced supply-demand, with prices expected to stabilize further.
*   **Future Demand:** The massive expansion of wind and solar power (targeting 3.6 billion kilowatts by 2035) will create enormous demand for energy storage, driven by both policy and technological advancements.
