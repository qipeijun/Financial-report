The article reports that on September 27, 2025, the Hangzhou Bay Cross-sea Railway Bridge, located in Haiyan, Zhejiang, achieved a significant milestone with the successful installation of its first 80-meter precast concrete box girder. This marks the bridge's entry into the upper structure construction phase.

Key details:
*   **Bridge Name:** Hangzhou Bay Cross-sea Railway Bridge.
*   **Location:** Haiyan, Zhejiang, China.
*   **Event:** The first 80-meter precast concrete box girder was successfully installed.
*   **Significance:** This 80-meter girder, weighing 2800 tons, is the longest precast concrete box girder in the world, setting a new global record and earning the title "World Beam King." Its installation signifies the bridge's comprehensive entry into the upper structure construction phase.
*   **Challenges:** Construction faced extreme conditions in Hangzhou Bay, including strong tides (max 8.96m tidal range, 5.3m/s current), frequent typhoons, and an unstable seabed.
*   **Solutions:** A specialized vessel named "Tianyi Hao" (Heavenly One) was developed for integrated transport and erection of the massive girders. This vessel, with a maximum lifting capacity of 3600 tons, uses precise tidal calculations and 85 smart sensors for real-time monitoring to ensure millimeter-level accuracy during installation.
*   **Specifications:** The bridge will be 29.2 kilometers long, designed for a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, making it the world's longest and highest-standard cross-sea high-speed rail bridge.
*   **Completion Timeline:** The main body of the sea-crossing approach bridge is expected to be completed by the end of 2026, and the bridge is projected to open to traffic by the end of 2027.
*   **Impact:** Its completion will enhance the road network in the Yangtze River Delta region and is crucial for promoting high-quality integrated development in the area.
