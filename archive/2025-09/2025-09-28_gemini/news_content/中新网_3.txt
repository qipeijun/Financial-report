*   **Product Features:**
    *   **Salad Chicken Breast:** Uses whole-cut, antibiotic-free chicken breast, processed with 6 core techniques (e.g., 360° vacuum tumbling, low-temperature marinating, gentle steaming, light roasting) to retain tenderness and juiciness. Available in various flavors like black pepper, basil, and cinnamon oolong, with simplified ingredients and clean labels.
    *   **Reduced-Salt Chicken Luncheon Meat:** Breaks from traditional canned luncheon meat processes, using emulsification +颗粒 and low-temperature slow cooking, with added Western spices to achieve the characteristic flavor of luncheon meat and the texture of ham.
*   **Strategic Significance:** This launch marks Shuanghui's deepened strategy in the healthy light food sector, expanding its product lines and aiming to meet consumers' growing demand for healthy, safe, nutritious, and delicious products. The company leverages its own farms (producing 300 million chickens annually) and antibiotic-free chicken raw materials, along with clean formula technology, to control the entire chain from farming to R&D and production.
