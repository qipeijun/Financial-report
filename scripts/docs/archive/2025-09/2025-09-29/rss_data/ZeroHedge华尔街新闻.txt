            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/assessing-reports-that-ukraine-is"><em>Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,</em></a></p>

<p><em><strong>Having captured Russian drones bomb NATO logistics hubs in Poland and Romania via a modern-day “Gleiwitz incident” could achieve Ukraine’s goal of sparking a hot NATO-Russian war...</strong></em></p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2845%29_4.jpg?itok=T3vjowHt"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="375" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2845%29_4.jpg?itok=T3vjowHt" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova raised global awareness of Hungarian media reports about a planned Ukrainian false flag drone provocation against NATO in <a href="https://t.me/MariaVladimirovnaZakharova/11468">her Telegram post</a> on Friday. She hyperlinked to one of the outlets, <a href="https://pestisracok.hu/vezercikk/2025/09/haboru-ukrajnaban-terkep-allohaboru-hazugsag">Pesti Srácok</a>, a little more than two hours after they published their editorial. It ended by citing unspecified Telegram posts about Ukraine’s plans to bomb logistics hubs in Poland and Romania with captured Russian drones and then blame Moscow.</p>

<p><strong>Accordingly, there’s no solid intelligence about this, just social media reports that were picked up by the Russian Foreign Ministry and amplified by their spokeswoman.</strong> Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean that such a scenario isn’t credible, especially given the larger context. Trump just greenlit NATO downing Russian jets that violate the bloc’s airspace, which could <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/nato-might-try-to-down-russian-jets">arguably embolden</a> some members to attempt this on false pretexts, thus risking a major escalation of NATO-Russian tensions exactly as Ukraine wants.</p>

<p>Likewise, if the most zealously anti-Russian ones along the alliance’s eastern frontier ultimately get cold feet after fearing that Trump might hang them out to dry, Ukraine could nudge them in the direction of offensive operations against Russia disguised as “reciprocal retaliation” via this false flag plot. The essence is similar to what Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service warned about <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/svr-once-again-warned-about-a-british">twice</a> over the summer regarding joint British-Ukrainian plots to stage false flag provocations in the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p><strong>According to their sources, this would involve Ukrainian-transferred Soviet/Russian torpedoes hitting a US ship there or at least exploding in close proximity to it and/or fishing up Ukrainian-transferred Soviet/Russian mines, either of which could suffice for pulling Trump into mission creep. </strong>They could also falsely justify offensive actions on the grounds of “reciprocal retaliation”, albeit at sea in these scenarios, while the latest one that Zakharova warned about could include drones, airstrikes, and/or a no-fly zone.</p>

<p>Russia continues to gradually gain ground in the <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/korybko-to-azerbaijani-media-all">special</a> <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/20-constructive-critiques-about-russias">operation</a> zone, and while no breakthrough has yet to occur, the military-strategic dynamics are clearly in its favor and decisively against Ukraine’s. Taken to its conclusion, this trend will inevitably result in Russia controlling all the disputed territory with time, thus enabling Moscow to end the conflict on more of its terms by then. Ukraine wants to avert that scenario so it’s desperately trying to engineer the game-changer of <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/direct-nato-intervention-in-ukraine">direct NATO intervention</a> to that end.</p>

<p>It’s only through such a dramatic development that the abovementioned dynamics could possibly be altered to at the very least <a href="https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/will-putin-agree-to-a-ceasefire">freeze the conflict</a>, which Ukraine and the West have demanded of Russia to no avail since that would leave unmet many of its goals in the conflict, ergo Ukraine’s false flag motives. Having captured Russian drones bomb NATO logistics hubs in Poland and Romania via a modern-day “Gleiwitz incident” as Zakharova described Ukraine’s reported plans to be might easily achieve that.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, while there’s no proof in support of the claim that Ukraine is preparing a false flag drone provocation against NATO, it still can’t be ruled out. </strong>Zakharova’s post was meant to expose this plot and thus deter Ukraine, but in the event that it still happens, Trump shouldn’t let himself be <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/zelensky-is-manipulating-trump-into">manipulated by Zelensky into a disaster of epic proportions</a> by involving the US in NATO’s faux “reciprocal retaliation” or pledging to defend the bloc ahead of Russia likely teaching it an unforgettably painful lesson afterwards.</p>

标题: Paralympic Body Finally Lifts Suspension Of Russia & Belarus

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Paralympic Body Finally Lifts Suspension Of Russia & Belarus</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Recall that in the opening months of the Russia-Ukraine war, authorities in Europe and the US began canceling all things Russian. Everything from <strong>famous Russian musical compositions</strong>, to Russian athletes' appearances in world competitions, to <strong>even great authors like Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy</strong> were basically <strong><em>banned</em></strong> from Western institutions and public mention.</p>

<p>Xenophobia was all the rage among Western liberals, and even Russian tea rooms in American cities were vandalized. <strong>Innocent individuals faced discrimination for mere Russian ethnicity or Russian-sounding names</strong>. Absurdly, alongside banning Russian teams under the Russian flag at the Olympics - something which never happened to team USA even as Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, killing some one million people according to some estimates - even Russia's Paralympic teams were barred.</p>

<p>That's right, not even Russia's disabled athletes could participate in world sports under their flag. Finally, this harsh and unnecessary measure has been reversed, as the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has <strong>voted to lift Russia's partial suspension</strong>, <strong>along with Belarus</strong>, finally allowing disabled athletes from the countries to participate under their national flags.</p>
<a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/pralympics%20russia.jpg?itok=MRvkYv9D"><figure class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" height="281" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/pralympics%20russia.jpg?itok=MRvkYv9D" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Via Reuters</em></figcaption></figure></a>

<p>As Russian media describes Saturday, the Paralympic ban is <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/625369-paralympics-russian-flag-anthem/">no more</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The IPC said in a statement on Saturday that its members at the organization’s General Assembly in Seoul, South Korea have voted not to maintain the partial suspension of the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC). In the final stage of the vote, 91 delegates supported lifting all restrictions on Moscow, with 77 being against it and eight abstaining.</em></p>

<p><em>“<strong>This decision means NPC (national Paralympic committee) Russia now regain their full rights and privileges of IPC membership</strong>... The IPC will work with NPC Russia to put practical arrangements in place for this as soon as reasonably possible,” the statement read.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ban on Russia and Belarus went back to 2022, though exceptions were later made which allowed some individual athletes to compete under a neutral flag.</p>

<p>Next, Moscow is going to lobby for a lifting of all of its athletes to compete under the national flag. Many viewers of the Summer and Winter Olympic games all over the globe have observed that the games have suffered in both quality and excitement of competition as a result of the Russian team remaining out.</p>

<p>Of course,<strong> Ukraine is furious</strong>, and wants the IPC to repeal its latest move. Ukraine’s Sports Minister Matviy Bidnyi has called it a <strong>betrayal of "conscience and the Olympic values."</strong></p>

<p><em>Kremlin officials celebrate the major decision in Russia's favor...</em></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">Paralympic Committee lifting Russia’s partial suspension 'LANDMARK event for world sport'<br /><br />
Sports Minister Degtyarev says it highlights 'illegality, perfidy and STUPIDITY' of sanctions on Russian athletes <a href="https://t.co/1vXeelpPyD">https://t.co/1vXeelpPyD</a> <a href="https://t.co/tbf5DqCvWy">pic.twitter.com/tbf5DqCvWy</a></p>

<p>"We call on our European partners, who will host the upcoming Winter Paralympic Games, not to allow the flag of the aggressor state to be raised over the free and democratic space while the war of aggression continues," he said. He suggested that Ukraine itself could mull dropping its participation in the games as form of protest. It would certainly be ironic if Ukrainian athletes didn't show up to compete, and the Russians did.</p>

标题: Slovakia Enshrines Two Genders In Constitution As Amendment Promoting 'National Identity' Passes By A Whisker

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Slovakia Enshrines Two Genders In Constitution As Amendment Promoting 'National Identity' Passes By A Whisker</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://rmx.news/article/slovakia-enshrines-two-genders-in-constitution-as-amendment-promoting-national-identity-passes-by-a-whisker/"><em>Authored by Thomas Brooke via Remix News,</em></a></p>

<p>Slovakia’s parliament has approved a constitutional amendment defining gender strictly as male and female,<strong> a move that has sparked both celebration among conservatives and fierce criticism from liberal and pro-European parties.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot-2025-09-26-133641.jpg?itok=_XUWJ4Ra"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="302" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot-2025-09-26-133641.jpg?itok=_XUWJ4Ra" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The measure, which required 90 votes to pass, was adopted on Friday after two deputies from the opposition Movement Slovakia broke ranks and supported the government’s proposal. Marek Krajčí and Rastislav Krátký, who had publicly pledged not to vote with Prime Minister Robert Fico’s ruling Smer party, switched positions at the last minute. They later said they wanted to help their allies in the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), which strongly backed the change.</p>

<p>The amendment, which takes effect on Nov. 1, <strong>enshrines “two genders – man and woman” in the Constitution of the Slovak Republic. </strong>It also bans surrogacy, reinforces parental rights in schools, and defines marriage and parenthood in strictly biological terms.</p>

<p><strong>The text states that the new rules are intended to protect “traditional values” and Slovakia’s “sovereignty in cultural and ethical matters.”</strong></p>

<p>It also ensures that EU law cannot override issues related to such matters, as lawmakers effectively ignored warnings from Brussels not to follow through with the amendment.</p>

<p>European Commissioner for Justice Michael McGrath penned a letter to Bratislava earlier this summer stating that the proposed amendments “raise concerns in connection with the principles of the primacy of European law.”</p>

<p><strong>“The primacy of EU law is not open for debate,”</strong> he warned.</p>

<p>Robert Fico hailed the result, thanking “influential people” who helped secure support, though he declined to name them. He said his party had made clear that Friday’s vote would be the last chance to anchor such provisions in the constitution.</p>

<p>The Christian Democrats welcomed the outcome. Party leader Milan Majerský said the amendment safeguarded human dignity and praised the deputies who ensured its adoption. <em><strong>“The constitution protects women in connection with surrogacy, but also children and families,” </strong></em>he said.</p>

<p>But liberal and centrist parties condemned the result. Michal Šimečka, leader of Progressive Slovakia, called the amendment “shameful” and said it would harm the country’s citizens while raising questions about Slovakia’s place in the European Union. He accused the Movement Slovakia of betraying its voters by siding with Fico. “After this, there can be no thought of cooperation with them,” he said.</p>

<p>Branislav Gröhling, leader of Freedom and Solidarity (SaS), also criticized the two deputies who switched sides. “One night was enough for the anti-corruption movement to change its mind and support Robert Fico,” he said. SaS lawmaker Mária Kolíková warned that the change could put Slovakia’s EU funding and membership in the Council of Europe at risk.</p>

<p>The right-wing Republic movement and the nationalist Slovak National Party welcomed the vote, calling it a historic moment that confirmed Slovakia’s commitment to traditional values.</p>

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">The Digital Gulag Is Being Erected Before Your Very Eyes</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Via <a href="https://x.com/newstart_2024">Camus</a> (<a href="https://x.com/newstart_2024">@newstart_2024</a>),</p>

<p>At the WEF 2025, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez presented a vision for the digital future that should send a chill down the spine of every free citizen.</p>

<p><strong>Framed as a solution to online harms, his proposal is, in reality, a blueprint for a panopticon of digital control, perfectly aligned with the globalist agenda of the World Economic Forum. </strong></p>

— Camus (@newstart_2024) <a href="https://twitter.com/newstart_2024/status/1970954790860644501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
<p><strong>What Sánchez Said: </strong></p>

<p><em>He called for an end to online anonymity, demanding that every social media profile in Europe be linked to a state-issued "European Digital Identity Wallet." </em></p>

<p><em>He compared the internet to public streets, arguing that just as one cannot drive without a license plate, one should not post online without a state-verified ID. </em></p>

<p><strong>What Sánchez Is Really Saying:</strong></p>

<p>He is declaring that the digital public square—the last truly global space for free, unvetted discourse—must be brought under the direct supervision of the state.</p>

<p>His rhetoric is a masterclass in misdirection:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>"Fighting misinformation" </strong>is code for establishing a verifiable identity for dissent. Under this system, any opinion deemed inconvenient by the authorities can be traced directly back to the citizen who voiced it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>"Ending cyber-harassment" </strong>is the pretext for ending digital privacy. The principle that one can speak without fear of state retribution is being reclassified as "impunity."</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>"Pseudonymity" </strong>is a Trojan horse. It offers the illusion of a nickname while ensuring that a government database holds the key to your real identity, accessible whenever "public authorities" deem your speech a "crime." This is not pseudonymity; it is state-mandated identity registration for speech.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>This is the ultimate goal of the WEF's "Great Reset" and "Digital ID" agenda: not safety, but control. <strong>It creates a system where participation in modern society is contingent on accepting a government-issued digital leash.</strong> The threat of being "banned or prosecuted" for undefined crimes will inevitably lead to self-censorship, silencing legitimate criticism and neutralizing opposition.</p>

<p><strong>Sanchez's second proposal—to "force open the black box of algorithms"—completes the picture.</strong> It is not about transparency for users, but about regulatory capture for the state. The goal is for governments to dictate what content is amplified and what is suppressed, shaping public opinion under the guise of managing "the public conversation."</p>

<p>This is not the path to a safer internet. It is the path to a sterile, state-managed internet where freedom is traded for the false promise of security. <strong>The globalist elite at the WEF are not solving the problems of the digital age; they are exploiting them to build the architecture of control.</strong></p>

标题: What's Behind Microsoft's Drastic Move To Cancel Services To Israeli Intelligence?

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">What's Behind Microsoft's Drastic Move To Cancel Services To Israeli Intelligence?</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Microsoft has restricted access to certain technologies for Israel's military intelligence Unit 8200 - an elite unit responsible for clandestine operations, especially collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT), along with counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, and surveillance. It is often also referred to as the Central Collection Unit of the Intelligence Corps</p>

<p>Reports emerged that the IDF unit <strong>violated the company's terms of service by using Microsoft's Azure cloud platform to collect and store mass surveillance data on Palestinians</strong>, according to <em>The Guardian</em>, <i>The Wall Street Journal, </i>and other prominent publications.</p>
<a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/mshq.jpg?itok=FkhIinI1"><figure class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" height="281" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/mshq.jpg?itok=FkhIinI1" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Via Reuters</em></figcaption></figure></a>

<p>A sophisticated surveillance system was erected by Israeli intelligence reportedly using Microsoft's infrastructure to collect data from <strong>millions of phone calls</strong> made daily by Palestinians across the West Bank and Gaza.</p>

<p>"We do not provide technology to support mass surveillance of civilians. This principle has guided our actions globally for over 20 years," Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith stated in an internal email to employees.</p>

<p>Microsoft has also since<strong> notified Israel’s Ministry of Defense that it will terminate and deactivate specific subscriptions</strong> and services used by the military. This is said to include access to certain cloud storage, AI tools, and related technologies.</p>

<p>Smith had further described the company took this drastic action due to its "longstanding protection of privacy as a fundamental right."</p>

<p>According to WSJ, it was initial media scrutiny which spurred on Microsoft's own investigation <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-cuts-back-work-with-israels-defense-ministry-bd4fae2a?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhqefL0wewzJwZUMiuqGB04eZGim8J4HDYnpoS_Qq1oiFRXG9JoBMzu8meRv-Y%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d8a644&amp;gaa_sig=Og1ZptP8NPsKdF6RncnIXJpZNLtM9z6FAMj7hdc25McbEsHfSXA15AeY_-UL8-OkchSkzPwfcabP9biezxL2dA%3D%3D">into the matter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p data="[object Object]"><em><strong>The company looked into the matter again following the Guardian article</strong>. Law firm Covington & Burling, Smith’s former employer and a longtime Microsoft legal resource, has been investigating the matter.</em></p>

<p data="[object Object]"><em>The company, which shared few details of its findings, said its policies prohibit its technology’s use to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians. It said it had found evidence that “elements of the Guardian’s reporting” were true.</em></p>

<p data="[object Object]"><em>Current and former <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/first-google-now-microsoft-tech-staff-are-in-revolt-over-gaza-44352d18?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">employees have criticized</a> the company’s relationship with Israel. <strong>Organizers have disrupted company conferences by shouting during keynote speeches and hung Palestinian flags and banners around the Microsoft corporate campus in Redmond, Wash</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft said that it had found key elements of the public investigative reporting to be true. It comes amid growing international outrage at the soaring Palestinian death toll in Gaza, and as PM Netanyahu has vowed to fully take over Gaza City.</p>

<p><em>Watch: Given this was <strong>likely known about or at least suspected for a long time</strong>, <strong>what's behind Microsoft's move?</strong></em></p>

<p></p>

<p>Pressure has been mounting among Microsoft's own employees for the powerful company to take more action since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>However, the company has made clear that it will continue to support Israel's cyber-defense efforts and other services which don't involve mass surveillance. </p>
