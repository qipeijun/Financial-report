<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2845%29_4.jpg?itok=T3vjowHt"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="375" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2845%29_4.jpg?itok=T3vjowHt" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova raised global awareness of Hungarian media reports about a planned Ukrainian false flag drone provocation against NATO in <a href="https://t.me/MariaVladimirovnaZakharova/11468">her Telegram post</a> on Friday. She hyperlinked to one of the outlets, <a href="https://pestisracok.hu/vezercikk/2025/09/haboru-ukrajnaban-terkep-allohaboru-hazugsag">Pesti Srácok</a>, a little more than two hours after they published their editorial. It ended by citing unspecified Telegram posts about Ukraine’s plans to bomb logistics hubs in Poland and Romania with captured Russian drones and then blame Moscow.</p>

<p><strong>Accordingly, there’s no solid intelligence about this, just social media reports that were picked up by the Russian Foreign Ministry and amplified by their spokeswoman.</strong> Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean that such a scenario isn’t credible, especially given the larger context. Trump just greenlit NATO downing Russian jets that violate the bloc’s airspace, which could <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/nato-might-try-to-down-russian-jets">arguably embolden</a> some members to attempt this on false pretexts, thus risking a major escalation of NATO-Russian tensions exactly as Ukraine wants.</p>

<p>Likewise, if the most zealously anti-Russian ones along the alliance’s eastern frontier ultimately get cold feet after fearing that Trump might hang them out to dry, Ukraine could nudge them in the direction of offensive operations against Russia disguised as “reciprocal retaliation” via this false flag plot. The essence is similar to what Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service warned about <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/svr-once-again-warned-about-a-british">twice</a> over the summer regarding joint British-Ukrainian plots to stage false flag provocations in the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p><strong>According to their sources, this would involve Ukrainian-transferred Soviet/Russian torpedoes hitting a US ship there or at least exploding in close proximity to it and/or fishing up Ukrainian-transferred Soviet/Russian mines, either of which could suffice for pulling Trump into mission creep. </strong>They could also falsely justify offensive actions on the grounds of “reciprocal retaliation”, albeit at sea in these scenarios, while the latest one that Zakharova warned about could include drones, airstrikes, and/or a no-fly zone.</p>

<p>Russia continues to gradually gain ground in the <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/korybko-to-azerbaijani-media-all">special</a> <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/20-constructive-critiques-about-russias">operation</a> zone, and while no breakthrough has yet to occur, the military-strategic dynamics are clearly in its favor and decisively against Ukraine’s. Taken to its conclusion, this trend will inevitably result in Russia controlling all the disputed territory with time, thus enabling Moscow to end the conflict on more of its terms by then. Ukraine wants to avert that scenario so it’s desperately trying to engineer the game-changer of <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/direct-nato-intervention-in-ukraine">direct NATO intervention</a> to that end.</p>

<p>It’s only through such a dramatic development that the abovementioned dynamics could possibly be altered to at the very least <a href="https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/will-putin-agree-to-a-ceasefire">freeze the conflict</a>, which Ukraine and the West have demanded of Russia to no avail since that would leave unmet many of its goals in the conflict, ergo Ukraine’s false flag motives. Having captured Russian drones bomb NATO logistics hubs in Poland and Romania via a modern-day “Gleiwitz incident” as Zakharova described Ukraine’s reported plans to be might easily achieve that.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, while there’s no proof in support of the claim that Ukraine is preparing a false flag drone provocation against NATO, it still can’t be ruled out. </strong>Zakharova’s post was meant to expose this plot and thus deter Ukraine, but in the event that it still happens, Trump shouldn’t let himself be <a href="https://korybko.substack.com/p/zelensky-is-manipulating-trump-into">manipulated by Zelensky into a disaster of epic proportions</a> by involving the US in NATO’s faux “reciprocal retaliation” or pledging to defend the bloc ahead of Russia likely teaching it an unforgettably painful lesson afterwards.</p>
