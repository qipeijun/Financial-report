Investment in data centers is rapidly increasing, driven by the AI boom, with annual spending in the US reaching $41 billion by July, nearly equaling the construction costs for all private office buildings.[1] This surge has been particularly pronounced since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, leading to data centers being categorized separately in official statistics.[1] Since July 2014, data center construction expenditure has increased by 2200%.[1]

Despite warnings from investors like David Einhorn about potential "capital destruction," figures like OpenAI's Sam Altman believe the current pace of construction is "still too slow" given long-term needs.[1] Future investment is expected to be even larger, with tech giants such as Nvidia, OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and Meta announcing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects.[1] Notable plans include a $100 billion, 10-gigawatt super data center project by Nvidia and OpenAI, OpenAI's $500 billion "Stargate" project with Oracle and SoftBank, and Meta's "Titan Cluster" data center initiative.[1]
