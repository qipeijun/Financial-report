The article "美国债市也“闻到了2007年的味道”" (US Bond Market Also "Smells Like 2007") discusses how the US bond market is exhibiting several characteristics reminiscent of the period before the 2007 financial crisis.

Key points include:
*   **Similarities to 2007:** A surge in leveraged buyouts, investment-grade bond risk premiums hitting a 27-year low, rising auto loan default rates, and the rapid expansion of the private credit market to $1.7 trillion.
*   **Bubble Signals:** Large-scale leveraged buyouts (e.g., a potential $50 billion acquisition of Electronic Arts Inc.), increasing auto loan defaults (e.g., Tricolor Holdings bankruptcy), and significant growth in the overall debt market, including corporate bonds for AI investment and private credit-backed bonds.
*   **Warnings from Experts:** Several prominent Wall Street figures, including Jamie Dimon and Jeffrey Gundlach, have expressed concerns about the optimistic pricing and high valuations in the corporate bond market.
*   **Distinctions from 2007:** The article notes that current conditions differ from 2007 due to stricter bank regulations, larger capital buffers, lower overall consumer borrowing, and more equity financing in leveraged buyouts.
*   **Outlook:** While a repeat of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis is generally not expected, analysts warn that "when assets are priced to perfection, any imperfection can trigger a correction." Investors may face a "bumpy road" and significant asset adjustments as the market adapts to early signs of economic slowdown, such as rising unemployment and declining consumer confidence.
