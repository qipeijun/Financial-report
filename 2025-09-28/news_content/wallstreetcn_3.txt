The article discusses Walmart CEO Doug McMillon's views on AI's impact on jobs. He states that "AI will change every job role" and that Walmart plans to maintain its global workforce of approximately 2.1 million employees over the next three years, but with significant changes in job composition.

Key points:
*   **AI's Impact:** McMillon believes AI will fundamentally alter every job.
*   **Workforce Strategy:** Walmart aims to keep its total employee count stable but will see major shifts in the types of roles available.
*   **Job Changes:**
    *   **Reductions:** Automation in warehouses, aided by AI, has already led to some job cuts.
    *   **New Roles:** Walmart is creating new positions, such as "agent builders" to develop AI tools.
    *   **Growth Areas:** The company expects to add staff in areas like home delivery and high-touch customer service (e.g., bakeries), as well as maintenance technicians and truck drivers.
*   **Industry Sentiment:** Other executives, including those from Ford, JPMorgan, Amazon, Accenture, and OpenAI, also anticipate significant changes and potential job displacement due to AI, though some believe the labor market will adapt.
