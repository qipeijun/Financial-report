A specialized Russian intelligence ship, the Yantar, is reportedly raising concerns among Western officials due to its movements around the British Isles.[1] The vessel, equipped with advanced surveillance technology, has been observed in strategic locations, including directly over undersea cables connecting Ireland and the UK.[1] Intelligence officials suspect the Yantar is gathering data and potentially preparing for sabotage operations, a concern amplified by its presence near critical undersea cables between Norway and the Svalbard archipelago.[1] According to a Financial Times investigation, the ship has been engaged in a 13-month surveillance operation targeting European infrastructure since autumn 2023.[1] There are fears of a repeat of previous incidents involving the cutting of Baltic Sea underwater telecommunications cables.[1]
