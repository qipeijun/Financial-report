The ZeroHedge article from September 27, 2025, reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General Pam Bondi is opposing Missouri's Second Amendment Preservation Act (SAPA).[1] Enacted in 2021, SAPA prevents state officials and resources from enforcing federal gun control measures that exceed constitutional limits, based on the principle that the federal government cannot compel states to implement federal policy.[1]

The DOJ, according to the article, views SAPA as an act of nullification and is attempting to invalidate the statute.[1] However, Gun Owners of America (GOA) argues that SAPA only prevents Missouri's officers from being conscripted to enforce federal gun laws, not from federal agents enforcing them, a distinction supported by constitutional precedent.[1]

The article criticizes Bondi's DOJ for continuing the Biden administration's legal strategy, which it claims contradicts President Trump's promises to protect Second Amendment rights.[1] It warns that invalidating SAPA could set a precedent that weakens states' ability to resist federal overreach, thereby undermining both the Second and Tenth Amendments.[1] The author urges Bondi's DOJ to respect Missouri's assertion of state authority in protecting constitutional rights.[1]
