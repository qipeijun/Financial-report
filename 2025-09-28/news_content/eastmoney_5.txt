The article reports that Shanghai Wahaha Drinking Water Co., Ltd. (上海娃哈哈饮用水有限公司) has launched a new bottled water brand called "Hu Xiaowa" (沪小娃). This move comes after the company's authorization to use the "Wahaha" brand expired in 2021 and 2023.

Key points:
*   **Brand Dispute:** Wahaha Group (娃哈哈集团) demanded that Shanghai Wahaha stop using the "Wahaha" trademark in July 2025 and reported them for infringement.
*   **Shanghai Company's Response:** Zong Wei (宗伟), chairman of Shanghai Wahaha (and reportedly a cousin/nephew of Wahaha founder Zong Qinghou), stated this was a "helpless move to survive" and that he could not reach Zong Fuli (宗馥莉) for communication. He also mentioned refusing the Group's suggestion for Shanghai Wahaha to undergo bankruptcy liquidation.
*   **Performance:** Shanghai Wahaha has been profitable for over 20 years, with revenue exceeding 120 million yuan last year, ranking among the top three in Shanghai's bottled water market.
*   **Broader Trademark Issues:** The article indicates that Zong Fuli herself might face challenges in using the "Wahaha" trademark due to historical issues requiring unanimous shareholder consent.
*   **"Wa Xiaozong" Brand:** Honsun Group (宏胜集团), associated with Zong Fuli, is reportedly preparing to launch a new brand "Wa Xiaozong" (娃小宗) for the 2026 sales year, with the trademark already owned by Honsun Group.
*   **Context:** Zong Fuli is also involved in a 10 billion yuan inheritance dispute, and some Wahaha distributors have reported a decline in sales.
