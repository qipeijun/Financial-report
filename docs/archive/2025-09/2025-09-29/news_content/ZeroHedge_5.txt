            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><strong>Long before the emergence of artificial intelligence,</strong> which many fear will make some jobs obsolete, technological advancements have altered the way people work, making some occupations disappear, while others emerged.</p>

<p>Did you know, for example, that people used to work as living alarm clocks before actual alarm clocks became a thing? <strong>“<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35840393/">Knocker uppers</a>”, as they were called, would walk around in industrial England, wielding a long stick with which they’d tap on workers’ doors to wake them in time for their shifts. </strong></p>

<p>There also used to be “computers” long before the arrival of personal computers. They were persons performing mathematical calculations, a service that is no longer required today.</p>

<p><strong>So which jobs might be next? </strong>Each year, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> publishes its Occupational Employment Projections - a report that's looking at the U.S. labor market as a whole for the next 10 years, projecting changes in employment by occupation and revealing which jobs are most at risk from <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7608/industrial-automation-worldwide/">automation</a> or other technological and societal shifts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/30161/decline-in-employment-levels-in-selected-occupations-by-2031/">As Statista's Felix Richter shows in the chart below, </a>based off its latest edition covering the 2024-2034 period, <strong>the BLS identified four occupational groups that are projected to lose jobs over the next decade</strong>: office and administrative support occupations, production occupations, sales and related occupations as well as occupations in farming, fishing and forestry.</p>

<p>As the chart shows, <strong>cashiers, who are at risk of being replaced by self-checkout, are projected to see the biggest drop in employment over the next decade </strong>with 313,600 fewer jobs in 2034 than in 2024.</p>

<p>Other jobs high on the list are office clerks and customer service representatives, the latter in particular vulnerable to the rise of AI-powered customer service chatbots.</p>

<p>When looking at relative employment changes, word processors and typists (-36 percent), roof bolters (-34 percent) and telephone operators (-27 percent) are the most quickly disappearing jobs, neither of which move the needle in absolute numbers, however, due to them being relatively rare occupations to begin with.</p>
