<p><em><strong>Something terrible is happening in Nigeria, and too few Americans, even Republicans, know it exists.</strong></em></p>

<p>For years, Nigeria has been one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a Christian. Radical groups like Boko Haram and Fulani militants have waged relentless campaigns of terror, massacring villages, kidnapping women and children, and destroying churches.</p>

<p>According to leading human rights groups, <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/266803/christian-persecution-in-nigeria-1200-churches-destroyed-annually-hundreds-killed">over 15 million Christians have been displaced since 2009</a>, tens of thousands killed, and more than 19,000 churches burned to the ground. Survivors describe a systematic attempt to erase Christianity from vast regions of the country.</p>

<p>Despite these staggering numbers, the story rarely breaks into Western headlines, and the silence has left millions unaware of the scale of the crisis.</p>

<p>However, that chilling reality got exposed on <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/real-time-with-bill-maher/abc00905-6a23-46f6-a531-20214bb06f37">Bill Maher’s show on Friday</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/real-time-with-bill-maher/abc00905-6a23-46f6-a531-20214bb06f37">Maher</a>, a proud atheist, had a surprising moment on air when he called out this slaughter of Christians that the media ignores.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">Bill Maher delivers a surprising moment on air as he calls out the slaughter of CHRISTIANS in Nigeria that the media refuses to cover.<br /><br />
“If you don’t know what’s going on in Nigeria, your media sources SUCK,” Maher said.<br /><br />
“You are in a BUBBLE. I’m not a Christian, but they are… <a href="https://t.co/XzDD3LYBPB">pic.twitter.com/XzDD3LYBPB</a></p>

<p>“If you don’t know what’s going on in Nigeria, <strong>your media sources SUCK</strong>,” <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/real-time-with-bill-maher/abc00905-6a23-46f6-a531-20214bb06f37">Maher</a> said bluntly.</p>

<p>“You are in a BUBBLE. I’m not a Christian, but <strong>they are systematically killing the Christians in Nigeria</strong>,” he continued.</p>

<p>“They’ve killed over 100,000 since 2009. They’ve burned 18,000 churches… <strong>They are literally attempting to wipe out the Christian population of an entire country.</strong>”</p>

<p>Pointing to the focus on Gaza, <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/real-time-with-bill-maher/abc00905-6a23-46f6-a531-20214bb06f37">Maher</a> asked, “<strong>Where are the kids protesting this?</strong>”</p>

<p>His diatribe drew a huge applause from the crowd, and a big thank you from <a href="https://x.com/NancyMace">Rep. Nancy Mace</a> (R – South Carolina) for putting a spotlight on the crisis.</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/real-time-with-bill-maher/abc00905-6a23-46f6-a531-20214bb06f37">Maher</a> responded.</p>

<p>For once, this story got the attention it deserved. And it took a classic liberal like Bill Maher — not the media — to put a spotlight on one of the greatest humanitarian crises of our time.</p>
