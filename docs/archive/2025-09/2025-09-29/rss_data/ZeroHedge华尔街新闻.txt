摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Yet Again, Deep State Attacks DNI Tulsi Gabbard</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2025/09/26/yet-again-deep-state-attacks-dni-tulsi-gabbard/"><em>Authored by 'sundance' via The Last Refuge,</em></a></p>

<p>It is <strong>difficult not to notice the strategy </strong>of how certain Trump administration officials are targeted.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Tulsi-Gabbard-HAL-9000.jpg?itok=kC1A6jdm"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="225" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Tulsi-Gabbard-HAL-9000.jpg?itok=kC1A6jdm" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Any cabinet member that looks inward to reveal the status of corrupt activity within the information silo itself becomes a target. Cabinet officials who focus externally, meaning the majority of their effort looks outside government, are seemingly left alone.</p>

<p>HHS Secretary RFK Jr and Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, are examples of those receiving the worst ideological targeting from operations within HHS and the Intelligence Community respectively.</p>

<p>Conversely, CIA Director John Ratcliffe faces almost no scrutiny or targeting by the Intelligence Community as the silo operators frame narratives almost exclusively against DNI Gabbard.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/24/tulsi-gabbard-undermines-probe-trump-russia">latest effort surfaces</a> as embeds within Main Justice and the CIA frame <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/24/tulsi-gabbard-undermines-probe-trump-russia">a storyline</a> that Tulsi Gabbard’s action in removing the security clearances of 37 current and former officials, has now resulted in those same officials being incapable of testifying against former CIA Director John Brennan (and others).</p>

<p><strong>The premise of the narrative is ridiculous. </strong> If we are to accept some current or former IC officials are willing to testify against Brennan (or others), regardless of whether Tulsi Gabbard has revoked their security clearances, their retroactive knowledge is still pertinent.  They are completely free to give statements and testimony based on their prior conduct.</p>

<p><strong>What the leakers to Axios and the New York Times are trying to establish, is groundwork for the removal of Tulsi Gabbard. </strong>This stops her objective of investigating internal corruption.  I suspect most of the people trying desperately to undermine Gabbard are from within the CIA Directorate of Analysis, or at least in alignment with the directorate’s agenda.</p>

<p>The narrative’s author, Marc Caputo, claims AG Pam Bondi is hampered in her effort to criminally indict John Brennan because the witnesses Main Justice would use have lost their security clearances.  <strong>Again, the game of leveraging internecine friendships in/around the office of Trump becomes an overlay.</strong></p>

<p>It is certainly true that AG Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have refused to look internally; and it is also true that DNI Tulsi Gabbard has spent much of her focus time looking internally.  Bondi and Patel continue the preferred game of institutional blame-casting in Main Justice. Meanwhile, Gabbard is busy focused on cleaning up her IC house.</p>

<p>The Fourth Branch embeds do not fear the approach of Bondi/Patel, but the Fourth Branch embeds are petrified by the approach of Tulsi Gabbard.  That reality underpins the baseline of opposition against the Director of National Intelligence.</p>

<p>As the dynamic unfolds, CIA Director John Ratcliffe is certainly not corrupt; however, nor is he brave.  Director Ratcliffe is willing to let Director Gabbard clean up his house, and then he takes credit for the reform.  As the weeks unfold into months, this is becoming increasingly obvious.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Zaid is the current anti-Trump Lawfare operative likely seeding the narrative to Axios/New York Times.</strong></p>

<p><em>Mark Zaid, a Trump administration critic who represents six of the intelligence professionals whose clearances were revoked, said administration officials fretting about the Brennan case have “valid concerns.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“This seems to be, as usual, an unforced error by Trump administration officials who don’t think things through in the long game in favor of a quick-pass completion,” he said. </em></p>

<p><em>“If I were the defense counsel [for Brennan], I would raise the revocation in an attempt to undermine the credibility of the witnesses.” (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/24/tulsi-gabbard-undermines-probe-trump-russia">more</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark Zaid knows the game-changing process that DNI Tulsi Gabbard is using.</p>

<p><strong>Gabbard is directly going into each IC agency to review and retrieve information. </strong> When she finds something that connects to the overall plots being used by the Fourth Branch, the DNI takes that information directly to President Trump who subsequently declassifies it and then she releases it.</p>

<p>Zaid and the Deep State operatives he represents, want to stop Tulsi Gabbard with urgency.  <strong> They are throwing every available IC narrative into the media flow in the hope that something stops Tulsi’s effectiveness.</strong></p>

<p>Massachusetts ($79,113), Washington ($76,323), Maryland ($74,982), and New Jersey ($74,164) round out the top five. These states benefit from strong tech, finance, and government sectors that boost wages significantly above the national level.</p>

<p>While it’s primarily coastal states that have a median full-time salary above $70,000, Colorado is the notable exception of a landlocked state with higher median earnings at $72,028.</p>

<h3>States with the Lowest Median Full-Time Salary in 2024</h3>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Mississippi ranks last with a median full-time salary of $50,120.</p>

<p>Other low-earning states include Arkansas ($50,899), Oklahoma ($51,676), West Virginia ($52,080), and Louisiana ($52,959). Many of these states are concentrated in the South, reflecting broader regional <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-mens-vs-womens-earnings-in-the-u-s/">wage gaps</a> tied to industry mix, job availability, and cost of living.</p>

<p>A clear divide emerges between coastal and interior states. High salaries cluster in the Northeast and on the West Coast, while much of the South lags behind the U.S. median of $61,702.</p>

标题: Republican, Democratic Leaders Dig In In Shutdown Standoff Ahead Of Meeting With Trump

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Republican, Democratic Leaders Dig In In Shutdown Standoff Ahead Of Meeting With Trump</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/house-senate-leaders-in-shutdown-standoff-ahead-of-meeting-with-trump-5921456">Authored by Jacob Burg via The Epoch Times</a> (emphasis ours),</em></p>

<p><strong>Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are digging their heels in ahead of a critical meeting with President Donald Trump to avoid a potential government shutdown this week</strong>, each pinning the blame for any negotiations that fail tomorrow on the opposing party.</p>
<a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28178%29_0.jpg?itok=klnrGYEa"><figure class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" height="333" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_80%28178%29_0.jpg?itok=klnrGYEa" width="500" /><figcaption><em>(L–R) House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) listen during a Hanukkah reception at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington on Dec. 17, 2024.

<p>Trump agreed to meet with Senate and House leaders of both parties on Sept. 29 to hopefully broker a deal to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded until a long-term spending bill can be passed.</p>

<p><strong>Democrats say that Republicans need to agree to extend certain tax <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/us/health-care-subsidies-a-sticking-point-in-shutdown-standoff-what-to-know-5920226">subsidies</a> for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace—also known as Obamacare</strong>—that were passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan and are set to expire at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Republicans are countering by saying the tax subsidy discussion can occur after passing a continuing resolution to keep the government afloat in the short term, saying the Affordable Care Act is beset by “waste, fraud, and abuse.”</p>

<p>A government shutdown is “totally up to the Democrats,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sept. 27.</p>

<p>“<strong>The ball is in their court</strong>,” he said. “So this decision, in my judgment, at this point in time, is up to a handful of Democrats. We need eight Democrats to pass it through the Senate, something that 13 times, when the Democrats had the majority over the last four years and President [Joe] Biden was in the White House, Republicans helped Democrats do.”</p>

<p>He said the tax credits don’t expire until the end of the year and that Democrats need to “release the hostage” on refusing to approve the continuing resolution before having that conversation on health care.</p>

<p>“That particular program is desperately in need of reform. It’s fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse, so we are going to have to have reforms if we take action there,” Thune said. “But I think there’s potentially a path forward.”</p>

<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said his coalition has been pushing for a meeting and “real negotiation” with Trump present, saying “we need the president as part of it.”</p>

<p>“<strong>We need Speaker Johnson; let the four leaders and the president sit down,</strong>” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sept. 28, referring to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and the meeting with Trump scheduled for 2 p.m. on Sept. 29.</p>

<p>Schumer said the Democrats are focused on health care.</p>

<p>“Rural hospitals are closing. People are going to get notices of $4,000-a-year increase in their premiums. So our job is to represent the people of America,” he said. “So far, they’ve stonewalled and said we’re not discussing any of that, and we'll see if it changes.”</p>

<p>Johnson said Trump is always open to talks but wants to “operate in good faith, so he decided to bring us all in.”</p>

<p>“He wants to talk with Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and just try to convince them to follow common sense and do what’s right by the American people,” Johnson told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sept. 28. “It’s important to point out the only thing we are trying to do is buy a little time.”</p>

<p><strong>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement that negotiations would hinge on “find[ing] a path forward to actually fix the health care system that Republicans have broken for the good of everyone.”</strong> He was referring to the expiring tax credits and cuts to Medicaid included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year.</p>

<p><strong>Johnson called the statement “absolutely absurd.”</strong></p>

<p>“The [topic of] Obamacare subsidies is a policy debate that has to be determined by the end of the year, Dec. 31,” Johnson said. “Not right now, while we’re simply trying to keep the government open so we can have all these debates.”</p>

<p>CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Johnson about health care experts who have said that Americans’ premiums could increase by as much as 75 percent—as early as October—if the Obamacare subsidies expire without extension, and pressed the House leader if he’s “worried at all that those people might blame Republicans for those health care costs, for the insurance costs going up.”</p>

<p><strong>“No, they’re not being truthful about that</strong>,” Johnson said. “The program doesn’t expire until the end of December, so we have time to have all those discussions and debates.”</p>

<p><strong>According to experts, the best way to maintain a new habit is to track it. </strong>I’ve recently taken up running. And as runners typically do, I’m now hooked on tracking my distance, measuring my pace, and setting goals to get better. Naturally, this sent me down the rabbit hole of finding the best tracking device.</p>

<p>There are many options<strong>. From Fitbit to Apple Watch to Garmin, there’s a wide variety of gadgets to monitor our habits.</strong> Especially since it’s a growing market. According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fitness-tracker-market-expected-generate-141500409.html">Yahoo Finance</a>, the global fitness tracker market was valued at $52.29 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $189.98 billion by 2032, growing 17.5 percent every year from 2026 to 2032. Looks like more and more people are interested in quantifying our health.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond smartwatches, there are also rings.</strong> Oura, a Finnish company, pioneered data tracking 10 years ago through a smart ring. The design is unobtrusive, and yet it has the capacity to measure all kinds of information, of course, at a price. To access its full power, you need to pay $349 for the ring plus a $6 monthly subscription.</p>

<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/oura-smart-ring-review-12ece82c?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=5&amp;page=1">reported</a> last year tha<strong>t Oura is “the leading smart-ring brand, with over 60 percent of the market,” representing 5 million rings <a href="https://ouraring.com/about-us?srsltid=AfmBOoqdN5edEB1WDuH_0vfgSA88u4TMOnTxUE4NvE0oAyBv3K_qXc3M">sold</a> worldwide.</strong></p>

<p>Oura and its competitors Ringcon and Ultrahuman have become popular for rings with nice aesthetics as well as a good capacity to track steps, heart rate, sleep cycles, and even menstrual health. But competition will be no more: earlier this year, the International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled against Ultrahuman and Ringcon for patent infringement, effectively <a href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-itc-case/?srsltid=AfmBOop8QQRMC92R5MAFfBqkmjhqnF0pq9PRGySoA8fMDHBcyaD-fT8M">banning them</a> from import and sales in the U.S. market starting Oct. 21.</p>

<p><strong>These rings may be less benign than they seem.</strong> On Aug. 27, Oura sent out a <a href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-us-department-of-defense/?srsltid=AfmBOoq5hH9rV5cXYklJUDPIN7x4u2_OEhRyA2Ymk1uK5fZjL1tqDp7s">press release</a> announcing a partnership with the Department of Defense (now unofficially renamed Department of War) and Palantir’s FedStart platform to support “population-level analysis of risk and readiness.” Whatever that means. This triggered all kinds of online <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@liamhaskett/video/7544827953343974670">backlash</a> over privacy concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Oura CEO Tom Hale <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/09/oura-ceo-tom-hale-data-privacy-oura-ring-defense-department-palantir/">said</a> that the company does not and “would never sell customer data.</strong>” That has not stopped users from literally <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMAALB5Ta/">trashing</a> their $349 smart rings. <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/09/oura-ceo-tom-hale-data-privacy-oura-ring-defense-department-palantir/">Privacy concerns, even if exaggerated by social media, should not be dismissed.</a></p>

<p>On the one hand, private companies profit from collecting data, but only if consumers willingly participate. If users feel betrayed, we cancel our subscriptions, delete the apps, and move on. That’s the market feedback loop. But it looks like the concern isn’t really about the companies but the possibility of the government accessing this private health data.</p>

<p>We’ve seen what this looks like in countries where the state is more overarching.<strong> In China, health surveillance is routine</strong>, and health data has become a tool for social control, especially after COVID. There’s a growing concern over the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4631578"><em>data leviathan</em></a> wherein the alliance of tech companies and the state enables “social governance” in what some are naming a new era of “digital authoritarianism.”</p>

<p>Science fiction, the art of “what ifs,” has long warned us of this. Some might remember <em>Gattaca</em>, where genetic information dictates social status. What appeared as a futuristic dystopia is getting closer to home. Cutting through the noise of social media, it seems like there’s a legitimate fear.</p>

<p>To be fair, most of us are already handing over vast amounts of personal information. Amazon knows our purchase patterns, Instagram holds our photos, and Google tracks nearly everything in between. It’s quite possible the government is aware of all of this. It’s not as if avoiding a smart ring or a fitness tracker puts us “off the grid.” The difference is one of intimacy: we’re measuring our sleep cycles, stress levels, physical recoveries—it’s the literal state of our bodies.</p>

<p><strong>While concerns might be overblown on social media, it does warrant the question: Should we be more careful and intentional about who we are sharing our sensitive data with?</strong></p>

<p>Granted, no one is forcing us to purchase these devices, but what’s concerning is how little thought is put into the amount of information we are willingly giving to tech companies, especially if it comes in a cute ring that goes with everyday lifestyle, but even more, whether or not there’s a government overreach and how they might use the info.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’ll keep running and tracking “manually,” and because I bring my phone with me, I’ll be sharing my health info with Apple (and Strava for my two friends who cheer me on, even though, as FEE’s Editorial Director <a href="https://lawliberty.org/book-review/the-all-seeing-eye-of-the-third-party/">pointed out</a> a few months ago, it’s leaking information). Until then, please read the terms and conditions. We might be feeding the machines & co. more information than we should. It’s not about what we’re tracking; in reality, it’s about <em>who</em> is tracking us.</p>

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">California Warns Fuel Traders Of Shortages That Threaten Fall Price Spike</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em>Nothing like micromanaging and overregulation to help a good ole' free market breathe and operate vibrantly.</em></p>

<p>California, already home to the highest gasoline prices in the U.S., is now bracing for another seasonal surge. <strong>The state’s energy regulator has cautioned gasoline traders that it is monitoring the market closely as refinery maintenance squeezes supplies.</strong></p>

<p>In a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom last week, the Division of Petroleum Market Oversight pointed to both planned and unexpected refinery outages, noting that such disruptions are common in autumn—and that sharp price increases also hit in 2022 and 2023, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-24/california-warns-gas-traders-ahead-of-threatened-fuel-shortage">Bloomberg reported this week</a>. </p>

<p>Average prices at California pumps reached $4.66 per gallon on Tuesday, $1.48 above the national average. The state’s unique fuel blends, required under strict environmental rules, make it harder to secure alternative supplies when local refineries shut down. Over time, the industry has also reduced capacity in California, further tightening the market.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2010.24.19.jpg?itok=c6wUs_df"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="328" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2010.24.19.jpg?itok=c6wUs_df" width="500" /></a></p>

<p><strong>So concerned are policymakers about another shortage that they’ve shifted their approach to oil refiners. Newsom, typically a critic of the industry, delayed implementation of a law he championed to cap refining profits</strong>. Legislators even debated offering hundreds of millions of dollars to keep a refinery from closing—once an unthinkable step.</p>

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-24/california-warns-gas-traders-ahead-of-threatened-fuel-shortage">writes</a> that while state leaders ease pressure on refiners, traders face heightened scrutiny. Oversight division director Tai Milder reminded them last week that the state “monitors the spot market daily for misconduct.” He warned that “anyone making purchases that drive fuel prices up, while also holding long positions they subsequently cash in on, will face scrutiny.”</p>

<p>California’s fuel market is thinly traded and heavily reliant on voluntary price reporting, making it vulnerable to manipulation. The state has also shown it is willing to act: in 2020, the attorney general sued Vitol Inc. and SK Energy Americas Inc. for manipulating the gasoline market during a 2015 spike. That case ended with a $50 million settlement last year.</p>
