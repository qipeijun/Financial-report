The article "The New Old Regime" by Samuel Rines discusses the potential for new sanctions and tariffs related to Russian oil, with a focus on China's involvement and the role of NATO[1]. The author highlights that this is not a new policy, but rather a continuation of previous efforts, noting that India was not singled out, and the focus was on isolating China for supporting the conflict[1].

A key point is the existing Price Cap Coalition (PCC), which was designed to limit the price of Russian oil while keeping it flowing to markets[1]. The article mentions that the EU has already moved to a "floating cap" for Russian crude, setting it at 15% lower than the average price of Russian Urals blend over the previous six months, which is currently less than $50[1]. This mechanism, which largely involves NATO countries, could be used to further pressure Russia by setting a prohibitively low price cap, such as $40[1].

The article also touches on Russia resorting to barter trade, citing examples like Chinese cars being traded for Russian wheat, and historical instances of Lada cars being bartered for Coca-Cola[1]. The author concludes that there is a readily available mechanism to implement incremental oil-related pressure on Russia, which could lead to lower oil prices and pressure Putin to end the war in Ukraine[1].
