摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Charlie Javice Gets 7 Year Jail Sentence For Defrauding JPMorgan</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Charlie Javice, the founder of a startup company that sought to improve how students apply for financial aid and who is best known for defrauding the world's largest commercial bank (to be fair a few banks in China are bigger but they areall state owned), was sentenced Monday to more than seven years in prison for cheating JPMorgan Chase out of $175 million by greatly exaggerating how many students it served.</p>
<a href="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/javice.jpg?itok=RW5_p7ro"><figure class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" height="334" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/javice.jpg?itok=RW5_p7ro" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Charlie Javice, Sept 29, 2025.</em></figcaption></figure></a>

<p>Javice, 33, was sentenced in Manhattan federal court for her March conviction by Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, who said she committed “a large fraud” by duping the bank giant in the summer of 2021. She made false records that made it seem the company, called Frank, had over 4.25 million customers when it had fewer than 300,000, Hellerstein found.</p>

<p>Frank, which JPMorgan shut down in early 2023 after spending shit ton of money on without doing any due diligence, pretended to offer a tool to help students fill out their Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, which is required by most colleges in making financial aid decisions.  A JPMorgan executive testified that the bank mistakenly thought Bank of America was also bidding for Frank. In reality, <strong>Capital One Financial Corp. withdrew a $125 million offer over regulatory, marketing and technological concerns on the same day JPMorgan made its bid for Javice’s company.</strong></p>

<p>JPMorgan executives testified at trial that they hoped to gain millions of new, young customers through the Frank Deal, which made Javice a managing director and head of student solutions at the bank. But the bank launched an internal investigation after an email marketing push to Frank users yielded only 10 new checking accounts, they said. </p>

<p>Jurors heard from a data scientist whom <strong>Javice paid $18,000 to create “synthetic” user data to provide to JPMorgan during her negotiations with the bank</strong>. Frank’s chief engineer testified that he had refused to create such data for Javice because he feared it might be illegal.</p>

<p>The judge said Javice had assembled a “very powerful list” of her charitable acts, which included organizing soup kitchens for the homeless when she was 7 years old and designing career programs for formerly incarcerated women.</p>

<p>“You’re a good person,” Hellerstein told Javice. <strong>“You’ve done a bad thing, and I have to punish you.”</strong> In addition to prison time, he ordered her to forfeit $22.4 million.</p>
<a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/javice%202.jpg?itok=0Z4B2T4c"><figure class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" height="334" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/javice%202.jpg?itok=0Z4B2T4c" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Charlie Javice, Sept 29, 2025.</em></figcaption></figure></a>

<p>“I am deeply sorry, and I am asking with all my heart for forgiveness,” Javice said through tears before her sentencing. “If it were within my power, I would never make the same mistakes again, not for money, not for recognition, not for anything.” Family members in attendance in the front row of the courtroom also wept as Javice spoke.</p>

<p>In court papers, defense lawyers noted that Javice has faced extraordinary public scrutiny, reputational destruction and professional exile, “making her a household name” in the same way Elizabeth Holmes became synonymous with her blood-testing company, Theranos. Which, considering both women are criminals, is hardly a shock. </p>

<p>Defense attorney Ronald Sullivan told Hellerstein that his client was very different from Holmes because what she created actually worked, unlike Holmes, “who did not have a real company” and whose product “in fact endangered patients.”</p>

<p>In seeking a 12-year prison sentence for Javice, prosecutors cited a 2022 text Javice sent to a colleague in which she called it “ridiculous” that Holmes got over 11 years in prison.</p>

<p>Prosecutors asked Hellerstein in a court filing for a stiff sentence, calling the crime a “brazen fraud” that she undertook to get JPMorgan to pay far more for her company than it was worth in the September 2021 deal. Javice’s lawyers on Monday suggested a sentence “in the neighborhood of 18 months.” They had called her actions a “single lapse in judgment” and claimed the loss was “not consequential” to a bank as big as JPMorgan.</p>

<p>Hellerstein largely dismissed arguments that he should be lenient because the acquisition pitted “a 28-year-old versus 300 investment bankers from the largest bank in the world,” as Sullivan put it.</p>

<p>“A fraud is a fraud, whether you outsmart someone who’s smart or someone who’s a fool,” the judge said, adding that he was focused on “her conduct, not JPMorgan’s stupidity.” Still he said JPM "have a lot to blame themselves” after failing to do adequate due diligence. He quickly added, though, that he was “punishing her conduct and not JPMorgan’s stupidity.”</p>

<p>Sullivan said the bank rushed its negotiations because it feared another bank would acquire Frank first.</p>

<p>A prosecutor, Micah Fergenson, though, said JPMorgan “didn’t get a functioning business” in exchange for its investment. “They acquired a crime scene.”</p>

<p>Fergenson said Javice was driven by greed when she saw that she could pocket $29 million from the sale of her company.</p>

<p>“Ms. Javice had it dangling in front of her and she lied to get it,” he said.</p>

<p>Given a chance to speak, Javice said she was “haunted that my failure has transformed something meaningful into something infamous.” She said she “made a choice that I will spend my entire life regretting.”</p>

<p>Javice, who lives in Florida, has been free on $2 million bail since her 2023 arrest. It means she has been wisely spending the money she stole from JPM.</p>

<p>At trial, Javice, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, was convicted of conspiracy, bank fraud and wire fraud charges. Having attracted clearly clueless investors like Apollo CEO Marc Rowan (not to be confused with Apollo's Leon Black who had a <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-releases-new-information-on-financing-of-jeffrey-epsteins-operations-by-billionaire-leon-black-seeks-documents-from-trump-administration">thing for even younger women</a>), Javice was one of several young startup founders with elite backgrounds convicted of fraud in recent years. The group includes FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried and Theranos Inc.’s Elizabeth Holmes.</p>

<p>Her lawyers had argued that JPMorgan went after Javice because it had buyer’s remorse.</p>

标题: Three-Week Shutdown Could Push Jobless Rate To 4.7%: Report

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Three-Week Shutdown Could Push Jobless Rate To 4.7%: Report</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><strong>A federal government shutdown looks increasingly inevitable as lawmakers remain deadlocked over how to fund the government for fiscal 2026 with just hours to go before the Oct. 1 deadline</strong>. None of the regular appropriations bills have cleared Congress, leaving agencies on the brink of closing their doors.</p>
<a href="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/us-government-shutdown-2025-layoffs_webp_92.jpg?itok=DvBBKPPY"><figure class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" height="281" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/us-government-shutdown-2025-layoffs_webp_92.jpg?itok=DvBBKPPY" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Photo: Jonathan Simcoe/Unsplash</em></figcaption></figure></a>

<p>The economic stakes are unusually high. The White House has threatened permanent dismissals of federal employees if the shutdown occurs, a move that could upend an already fragile labor market and potentially derail a tentative recovery. Economists warn that if the economy is as close to recession as many analysts believe, sharp government cuts could push it over the edge.</p>

<h2>GDP Effects Likely Contained—If Shutdown Ends Quickly</h2>

<p>The Federal Reserve’s rule of thumb is that each week of shutdown trims 0.2 percentage point from annualized GDP growth in the affected quarter. But the lost output is usually recovered once the government reopens, meaning the longer-term trajectory of the economy is little changed if the episode is contained within a single quarter.</p>

<p>That dynamic helps explain why the 34-day shutdown of late 2018 - the longest since 1981 - had little measurable impact on growth in the fourth quarter of that year.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-09-29%20at%2009-49-40%20US%20INSIGHT%20Government%20Shutdown.pdf%20-%20US%20INSIGHT%20Government%20Shutdown.pdf_.png?itok=3-dDHG0s"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="278" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-09-29%20at%2009-49-40%20US%20INSIGHT%20Government%20Shutdown.pdf%20-%20US%20INSIGHT%20Government%20Shutdown.pdf_.png?itok=3-dDHG0s" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>If the coming shutdown begins Oct. 1 and ends by mid-November, the bulk of the economic effect would likely be reversed before year-end, leaving fourth-quarter GDP intact.</p>

<h2>Labor Market Distortions</h2>

<p>The effect on employment data could be more immediate and visible. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly household survey counts furloughed federal employees as unemployed if they remain idle through the Oct. 12-18 reference week. Economists estimate that as many<strong> as 640,000 workers could be sidelined, lifting the unemployment rate by 0.4 percentage point to 4.7% - a sharp uptick for a single month.</strong></p>

<p>By contrast, the establishment survey, which underpins nonfarm payrolls, is unlikely to register the same disruption because furloughed employees will eventually receive back pay and remain on payrolls.</p>

<p>If the shutdown is resolved, the unemployment rate would likely revert to its prior level as furloughed workers are recalled. But if President Donald Trump follows through on threats to make dismissals permanent,<strong> the unemployment rate could remain elevated above 4.5% for months.</strong></p>

<h2>Agencies Brace for Deep Cuts</h2>

<p><strong>The Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, is preparing to furlough <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-government-shutdown-furlough-41-health-agency-workers-2025-09-29">41% of its staff</a> - about 32,460 workers</strong> - disrupting public health operations, research, and oversight. Within HHS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would furlough roughly 64% of its workforce, and the National Institutes of Health about 75%. Critical programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and essential food and drug safety functions will see partial continuity, though their capacity may be strained.</p>

<p>In parallel, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget has asked agencies to finalize <strong>reduction-in-force (RIF)</strong> plans - frameworks for eliminating positions permanently, not merely temporarily suspending them.Political leaders on the Democratic side have called the directive an intimidation tactic and pledged to resist.</p>

<p>In aviation, the fallout could be immediate. A funding lapse would suspend hiring and training of air traffic controllers - a problem especially acute given the FAA’s existing shortfall of some 3,000 controllers. The U.S. Travel Association warns of as much as <strong>$1 billion in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-funding-lapse-would-halt-air-traffic-controller-training-group-says-2025-09-25/">weekly losses</a></strong> tied to delays, cancellations, and operational disruption.</p>

<h2>Data Blind Spots for Policymakers</h2>

<p><strong>Shutdowns create an additional headache for the Fed: data blackouts</strong>. If the government shuts down on Oct. 1, the release of initial jobless claims scheduled for Oct. 2 and the September payrolls report on Oct. 3 would likely be delayed. <strong>A prolonged closure could also push back key October releases</strong>, including the consumer price index (Oct. 15), retail sales (Oct. 16) and the producer price index (Oct. 16).</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-09-29%20at%2009-50-21%20US%20INSIGHT%20Government%20Shutdown.pdf%20-%20US%20INSIGHT%20Government%20Shutdown.pdf_.png?itok=abqUV6vH"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="324" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-09-29%20at%2009-50-21%20US%20INSIGHT%20Government%20Shutdown.pdf%20-%20US%20INSIGHT%20Government%20Shutdown.pdf_.png?itok=abqUV6vH" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>That would leave Fed officials with little visibility into labor-market and inflation trends heading into their Oct. 28-29 policy meeting—a particularly precarious moment if recession risks are mounting.</p>

<p><strong>Since 1981, most shutdowns have lasted less than a week</strong>. Only three extended beyond two weeks: in 1995, 2013 and 2018. The 2018-19 episode stretched 34 days, disrupting everything from air travel to food inspections.</p>

<p>If the coming shutdown matches that duration, it would again test the resilience of federal services and potentially leave the Fed and markets in the dark about the state of the economy well into November.</p>

<p><strong>The likelihood of a shutdown as of midnight Oct. 1 is high</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/polym.jpg?itok=ECcYWzGr"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="264" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/polym.jpg?itok=ECcYWzGr" width="500" /></a></p>

<p><strong>A three-week stoppage</strong> - the current baseline expectation - <strong>could temporarily push the unemployment rate near 4.7% </strong>before normalizing. But if mass layoffs occur or the impasse drags on, the labor market and economy could face lasting damage. <strong>For now, the greatest immediate risk may be to policymakers themselves, forced to steer the economy without their most critical gauges</strong>.</p>

标题: "Let Your Rage Fuel You": Politicians And Pundits Embrace Rage Politics

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">"Let Your Rage Fuel You": Politicians And Pundits Embrace Rage Politics</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2025/09/29/let-your-rage-fuel-you-politicians-and-pundits-embrace-rage-politics/comment-page-2/">Authored by Jonathan Turley via jonathanturley.org</a>,</em></p>

<p>“<strong>Let your rage fuel you.</strong>” Those words from Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee <a href="https://thehill.com/people/abigail-spanberger/">Abigail Spanberger </a>captured what I have called “rage politics” in America.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gPIJ6GYrQwCfSAinBrIESw-e1759074290137_jpg_92.jpg?itok=7ohEALhz"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="375" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gPIJ6GYrQwCfSAinBrIESw-e1759074290137_jpg_92.jpg?itok=7ohEALhz" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Across the country, politicians and pundits are fueling rage, encouraging voters to embrace it. If you turn on the television, you would think that Darth Sidious had taken over: “<strong>Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you grow stronger</strong>.”</p>

<p>I do not think for a second that Spanberger supports violence. She was sharing with voters the “sage advice” of her mother, which she said she has applied in her political career. However, the anger is all around us.</p>

<p><strong>Recently, I <a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2025/09/23/the-turley-klarman-debate-a-video-and-a-response/">debated </a>Harvard Law Professor Michael Klarman, who declared, “I am very angry” and “I am enraged.”</strong> In denouncing ICE as “thugs” and saying Trump supporters are “fascists,” Klarman explained that the rage had a purpose: “to shake people out of their insomnia.”</p>

<p>Rage, however, comes at a cost in politics. I recently wrote a book about rage and free speech, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Indispensable-Right/Jonathan-Turley/9781668047040">The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage</a>.”<em> </em>It discusses our history of rage politics and how it has led to violence and crackdowns. Rage gives people a license to say and do things that they would not otherwise say or do. It is addictive, it is contagious, and it is dangerous.</p>

<p>We are seeing the result of rage rhetoric all around us. <strong>That includes the assassination of <a href="https://thehill.com/people/charlie-kirk/">Charlie Kirk </a>and the sniper attack on ICE agents in Texas this week, in addition to violent protests around the country.</strong></p>

<p>Rage allows you to deny the humanity of those you disagree with. Recently, two sisters were caught on video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4yiuWvCsSA">destroying a memorial</a> to Kirk. Kerri and Kaylee Rollo were later arrested. However, they immediately opened a GoFundMe site to call for donations for “fighting fascism” and Kaylee wrote “my sibling was fired from their job.” Hundreds of donors gave the sisters thousands of dollars as a reward for the latest such attack on a Kirk memorial.</p>

<p>For many months, some of us have warned that violent rhetoric was crossing over into political violence. Democratic politicians have spent months ratcheting up the rhetoric against ICE agents, who have suffered more than a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/22/despite-1000-increase-assaults-ice-officers-governor-newsom-signs-unconstitutional">1,000 percent</a> <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/22/despite-1000-increase-assaults-ice-officers-governor-newsom-signs-unconstitutional">increase</a> in attacks, including the recent sniper attack.</p>

<p><strong>Gov. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gavin-newsom/">Gavin Newsom </a>(D), the day before that attack, signed a law that purports to bar ICE agents from wearing masks in California. He openly mocked them, asking, “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-silent-anti-ice-rhetoric-after-dallas-shooting-despite-urging-nonviolence">What are you afraid of?</a>“</strong></p>

<p><strong>Joshua Jahn <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-joshua-jahn-shooter-deadly-dallas-ice-facility-attack">answered that question</a> the following day in Texas when he fired at ICE personnel, only to shoot three of their detainees.</strong></p>

<p>Previously, Newsom had warned voters that Trump was building ICE into a personal army that might be used to suppress voting in the upcoming midterm elections. “Do you think ICE is not going to show up around voting and polling booths to chill participation?” he said.</p>

<p>Others added to the rage rhetoric by declaring the impending death of democracy and lashing out at ICE. Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jasmine-crockett/">Jasmine Crockett </a>(D-Texas), who has used violent rhetoric in the past, declared that ICE agents were acting like “slave patrols” in hunting down immigrants in the streets.</p>

<p>Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/tim-walz/">Tim Walz </a>(D) used a commencement address to denounce “<a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/">Donald Trump’s </a>modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets. They’re in unmarked vans, wearing masks, being shipped off to foreign torture dungeons… just grabbed up by masked agents, shoved into those vans, and disappeared.”</p>

<p><strong>Others, like Boston Mayor Michele Wu, echoed the claims that ICE personnel are “Nazis” and called ICE Trump’s “secret police.”</strong></p>

<p>The rage rhetoric (and claims of a fascist takeover) has been adopted by a wide range of Democratic politicians, often using the same catchphrases of an “authoritarian playbook.” In our debate, Professor Klarman warned that this was all “authoritarianism rooted in old-fashioned white supremacy.”</p>

<p>As discussed in my book, politicians and pundits have long sought to ride the wave of rage into power or influence. Rage is a powerful narcotic. The problem is when it becomes an addiction. There is always a certain percentage of the population that will believe such hyperbolic claims.</p>

<p>Those are the people who end up trying to kill jurists like Justice <a href="https://thehill.com/people/brett-kavanaugh/">Brett Kavanaugh </a>or politicians like Trump. It was also seen in the assassination of Democratic politicians earlier this year in Minnesota.</p>

<p>With the recent assassination and attacks on ICE, some are expressing regret. One of the most telling was Hillary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/clinton/">Clinton </a>on MSNBC, who said that we should “stop demonizing each other” while blaming “the right” for most of the hate. It was a curious call from a woman who called Trump supporters “deplorables” and suggested that they should collectively be forced into “deprogramming” as a cult. Just before the interview, Clinton had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-sparks-social-media-firestorm-promoting-book-warning-about-fascists-sick-people">embraced the “fascism” mantra</a> and, during the interview, she went right back to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/hillary-clinton-warns-against-finger-pointing-seconds-after-blaming-the-right-for-tense-political-climate/">attacking Republicans</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5520112-survey-political-crisis-in-us/">new poll</a> shows that 71 percent view political violence as a serious problem, but the rage rhetoric continues unabated.</strong></p>

<p>The perfunctory calls for lowering the temperature after the latest shooting are unlikely to last. Key figures in public life keep injecting rage directly into the veins of American politics. It is hard to go “cold turkey” in breaking that addiction, but you first have to want to do so. There is no indication that our rage-addicts are anywhere near a step-program for recovery. If history is any measure, this fever will only break when voters clearly reject the politics of rage.</p>

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Dark-Money NGO Network Pressures Democrats To Shut Government Down</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Part of the Democratic Party's dark-money, billionaire-funded NGO network has repositioned its activist groups to unleash a campaign that mobilizes left-wing voters to mount a full-blown pressure campaign against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democratic senators not to concede to President Trump, thereby voting against government funding and triggering a partial shutdown. </p>

<p>"<strong>CALL NOW: Tell Your Democratic Senator(s) to Make Sure Schumer Doesn't Hand Trump a Blank Check</strong>," far-left activist group Indivisible wrote on its website. </p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-09-29_10-39-25.png?itok=96W404nw"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="328" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-09-29_10-39-25.png?itok=96W404nw" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>In a recent ZeroHedge NGO money-mapping report, <a href="https://x.com/peterschweizer">Peter Schweizer</a> and <a href="https://x.com/seamusbruner">Seamus Bruner</a> of the <a href="https://x.com/Govt_Acct_Inst">Government Accountability Institute</a> (GAI) exposed that the Indivisible Project (<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/dark-money-network-funneled-millions-no-kings-nationwide-color-revolution-operation">read report</a>), the official organizer of the "No Kings" protest, has received millions of dollars in funding from the Arabella Advisors network. This web of dark-money NGOs bankrolls the protest industrial complex that has waged continuous war on President Trump, the 'America First' agenda, and by extension, all of the president's supporters nationwide. </p>

<p>Indivisible continued in the call to action to Democrats:</p>

<p><strong><em>Federal government funding runs out on September 30—and Republicans need Democratic votes to clear the filibuster and avoid a government shutdown. Democrats have a strong hand to play. They must use it to deny Donald Trump the blank check Republicans want to hand him!</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>But in the last big funding fight, Chuck Schumer and a handful of other Dems surrendered—rolling over and letting Trump weaponize federal funds to rob our services, militarize our cities, and terrorize our communities. That cannot happen again.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Use this form to call your Democratic senator(s). Remind them we cannot hand blank checks to a wannabe king—and ask them to keep publicly pressuring  Schumer to FIGHT LIKE HELL!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Readers may recall that the Arabella network has been in the news, including in an unlikely outlet: The New York Times (<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/gates-foundation-cuts-ties-arabella-advisors-linked-funding-radical-leftist-causes">read report).</a> In August, the paper reported that the Gates Foundation abruptly halted funding for leftist nonprofit funds managed by the Arabella empire in late June. </p>

<p><strong>One of California’s top federal prosecutors issued a memo Friday rejecting Gov. <a href="https://headlineusa.com/tag/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom’s</a> law banning both local and federal officers from wearing masks during operations. </strong></p>

<p>Bilal Essayli, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, addressed the memo to federal officers in the district, instructing them to ignore the law and follow federal procedures established by the Constitution and legal precedent.  </p>

<p>He warned that any state official who thwarts federal operations would face prosecution. </p>

<p>“<strong>I direct federal law enforcement to continue to comply with federal law and follow their agency policies on the appropriateness of wearing masks when conducting federal law enforcement operations</strong>,” Essayli wrote in a two-page memo.  </p>

<p>“Any state official or private individual that unlawfully interferes or impedes federal law enforcement operations should be referred to my office for prosecution,” he added. </p>

— Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli (@USAttyEssayli) <a href="https://twitter.com/USAttyEssayli/status/1971625330722119843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
<p>Essayli’s guidance comes less than a week after Newsom signed SB 627, a controversial law that aims to criminalize facial coverings for law enforcement officers in the Golden State. </p>

<p><strong>The bill — signed Sept. 20 and effective Jan. 1, 2026 — also targets federal immigration agents wearing masks while apprehending criminal illegal aliens. </strong></p>

<p>The Trump administration repeatedly defended the use of masks, saying they are necessary in response to growing threats against federal officers.</p>

<p>Just this week, a gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, killing one detainee and injuring two others. The suspect, 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, allegedly attacked to instill terror among ICE officers. </p>

<p>It remains unclear how Newsom plans to enforce the law. </p>

<p>Essayli said Newsom was “confused” about his constitutional authority in a separate statement on X. </p>

<p>“<strong>He oversees California, not federal agencies. He should review the Supremacy Clause</strong>,” Essayli said. “California’s law to ‘unmask’ federal agents is unconstitutional, as the state lacks jurisdiction to interfere with federal law enforcement. I have directed federal agencies to disregard this state law and adhere to federal law and agency policies.”</p>
