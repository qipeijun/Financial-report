摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">"Let Your Rage Fuel You": Politicians And Pundits Embrace Rage Politics</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2025/09/29/let-your-rage-fuel-you-politicians-and-pundits-embrace-rage-politics/comment-page-2/">Authored by Jonathan Turley via jonathanturley.org</a>,</em></p>

<p>“<strong>Let your rage fuel you.</strong>” Those words from Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee <a href="https://thehill.com/people/abigail-spanberger/">Abigail Spanberger </a>captured what I have called “rage politics” in America.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gPIJ6GYrQwCfSAinBrIESw-e1759074290137_jpg_92.jpg?itok=7ohEALhz"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="375" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gPIJ6GYrQwCfSAinBrIESw-e1759074290137_jpg_92.jpg?itok=7ohEALhz" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Across the country, politicians and pundits are fueling rage, encouraging voters to embrace it. If you turn on the television, you would think that Darth Sidious had taken over: “<strong>Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you grow stronger</strong>.”</p>

<p>I do not think for a second that Spanberger supports violence. She was sharing with voters the “sage advice” of her mother, which she said she has applied in her political career. However, the anger is all around us.</p>

<p><strong>Recently, I <a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2025/09/23/the-turley-klarman-debate-a-video-and-a-response/">debated </a>Harvard Law Professor Michael Klarman, who declared, “I am very angry” and “I am enraged.”</strong> In denouncing ICE as “thugs” and saying Trump supporters are “fascists,” Klarman explained that the rage had a purpose: “to shake people out of their insomnia.”</p>

<p>Rage, however, comes at a cost in politics. I recently wrote a book about rage and free speech, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Indispensable-Right/Jonathan-Turley/9781668047040">The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage</a>.”<em> </em>It discusses our history of rage politics and how it has led to violence and crackdowns. Rage gives people a license to say and do things that they would not otherwise say or do. It is addictive, it is contagious, and it is dangerous.</p>

<p>We are seeing the result of rage rhetoric all around us. <strong>That includes the assassination of <a href="https://thehill.com/people/charlie-kirk/">Charlie Kirk </a>and the sniper attack on ICE agents in Texas this week, in addition to violent protests around the country.</strong></p>

<p>Rage allows you to deny the humanity of those you disagree with. Recently, two sisters were caught on video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4yiuWvCsSA">destroying a memorial</a> to Kirk. Kerri and Kaylee Rollo were later arrested. However, they immediately opened a GoFundMe site to call for donations for “fighting fascism” and Kaylee wrote “my sibling was fired from their job.” Hundreds of donors gave the sisters thousands of dollars as a reward for the latest such attack on a Kirk memorial.</p>

<p>For many months, some of us have warned that violent rhetoric was crossing over into political violence. Democratic politicians have spent months ratcheting up the rhetoric against ICE agents, who have suffered more than a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/22/despite-1000-increase-assaults-ice-officers-governor-newsom-signs-unconstitutional">1,000 percent</a> <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/22/despite-1000-increase-assaults-ice-officers-governor-newsom-signs-unconstitutional">increase</a> in attacks, including the recent sniper attack.</p>

<p><strong>Gov. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gavin-newsom/">Gavin Newsom </a>(D), the day before that attack, signed a law that purports to bar ICE agents from wearing masks in California. He openly mocked them, asking, “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-silent-anti-ice-rhetoric-after-dallas-shooting-despite-urging-nonviolence">What are you afraid of?</a>“</strong></p>

<p><strong>Joshua Jahn <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-joshua-jahn-shooter-deadly-dallas-ice-facility-attack">answered that question</a> the following day in Texas when he fired at ICE personnel, only to shoot three of their detainees.</strong></p>

<p>Previously, Newsom had warned voters that Trump was building ICE into a personal army that might be used to suppress voting in the upcoming midterm elections. “Do you think ICE is not going to show up around voting and polling booths to chill participation?” he said.</p>

<p>Others added to the rage rhetoric by declaring the impending death of democracy and lashing out at ICE. Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jasmine-crockett/">Jasmine Crockett </a>(D-Texas), who has used violent rhetoric in the past, declared that ICE agents were acting like “slave patrols” in hunting down immigrants in the streets.</p>

<p>Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/tim-walz/">Tim Walz </a>(D) used a commencement address to denounce “<a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/">Donald Trump’s </a>modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets. They’re in unmarked vans, wearing masks, being shipped off to foreign torture dungeons… just grabbed up by masked agents, shoved into those vans, and disappeared.”</p>

<p><strong>Others, like Boston Mayor Michele Wu, echoed the claims that ICE personnel are “Nazis” and called ICE Trump’s “secret police.”</strong></p>

<p>The rage rhetoric (and claims of a fascist takeover) has been adopted by a wide range of Democratic politicians, often using the same catchphrases of an “authoritarian playbook.” In our debate, Professor Klarman warned that this was all “authoritarianism rooted in old-fashioned white supremacy.”</p>

<p>As discussed in my book, politicians and pundits have long sought to ride the wave of rage into power or influence. Rage is a powerful narcotic. The problem is when it becomes an addiction. There is always a certain percentage of the population that will believe such hyperbolic claims.</p>

<p>Those are the people who end up trying to kill jurists like Justice <a href="https://thehill.com/people/brett-kavanaugh/">Brett Kavanaugh </a>or politicians like Trump. It was also seen in the assassination of Democratic politicians earlier this year in Minnesota.</p>

<p>With the recent assassination and attacks on ICE, some are expressing regret. One of the most telling was Hillary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/clinton/">Clinton </a>on MSNBC, who said that we should “stop demonizing each other” while blaming “the right” for most of the hate. It was a curious call from a woman who called Trump supporters “deplorables” and suggested that they should collectively be forced into “deprogramming” as a cult. Just before the interview, Clinton had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-sparks-social-media-firestorm-promoting-book-warning-about-fascists-sick-people">embraced the “fascism” mantra</a> and, during the interview, she went right back to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/hillary-clinton-warns-against-finger-pointing-seconds-after-blaming-the-right-for-tense-political-climate/">attacking Republicans</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5520112-survey-political-crisis-in-us/">new poll</a> shows that 71 percent view political violence as a serious problem, but the rage rhetoric continues unabated.</strong></p>

<p>The perfunctory calls for lowering the temperature after the latest shooting are unlikely to last. Key figures in public life keep injecting rage directly into the veins of American politics. It is hard to go “cold turkey” in breaking that addiction, but you first have to want to do so. There is no indication that our rage-addicts are anywhere near a step-program for recovery. If history is any measure, this fever will only break when voters clearly reject the politics of rage.</p>

标题: Dark-Money NGO Network Pressures Democrats To Shut Government Down

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Dark-Money NGO Network Pressures Democrats To Shut Government Down</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Part of the Democratic Party's dark-money, billionaire-funded NGO network has repositioned its activist groups to unleash a campaign that mobilizes left-wing voters to mount a full-blown pressure campaign against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democratic senators not to concede to President Trump, thereby voting against government funding and triggering a partial shutdown. </p>

<p>"<strong>CALL NOW: Tell Your Democratic Senator(s) to Make Sure Schumer Doesn't Hand Trump a Blank Check</strong>," far-left activist group Indivisible wrote on its website. </p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-09-29_10-39-25.png?itok=96W404nw"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="328" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-09-29_10-39-25.png?itok=96W404nw" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>In a recent ZeroHedge NGO money-mapping report, <a href="https://x.com/peterschweizer">Peter Schweizer</a> and <a href="https://x.com/seamusbruner">Seamus Bruner</a> of the <a href="https://x.com/Govt_Acct_Inst">Government Accountability Institute</a> (GAI) exposed that the Indivisible Project (<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/dark-money-network-funneled-millions-no-kings-nationwide-color-revolution-operation">read report</a>), the official organizer of the "No Kings" protest, has received millions of dollars in funding from the Arabella Advisors network. This web of dark-money NGOs bankrolls the protest industrial complex that has waged continuous war on President Trump, the 'America First' agenda, and by extension, all of the president's supporters nationwide. </p>

<p>Indivisible continued in the call to action to Democrats:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Federal government funding runs out on September 30—and Republicans need Democratic votes to clear the filibuster and avoid a government shutdown. Democrats have a strong hand to play. They must use it to deny Donald Trump the blank check Republicans want to hand him!</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>But in the last big funding fight, Chuck Schumer and a handful of other Dems surrendered—rolling over and letting Trump weaponize federal funds to rob our services, militarize our cities, and terrorize our communities. That cannot happen again.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Use this form to call your Democratic senator(s). Remind them we cannot hand blank checks to a wannabe king—and ask them to keep publicly pressuring  Schumer to FIGHT LIKE HELL!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Readers may recall that the Arabella network has been in the news, including in an unlikely outlet: The New York Times (<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/gates-foundation-cuts-ties-arabella-advisors-linked-funding-radical-leftist-causes">read report).</a> In August, the paper reported that the Gates Foundation abruptly halted funding for leftist nonprofit funds managed by the Arabella empire in late June. </p>

<p>GAI's Schweizer and Bruner revealed that the Gates Foundation has funneled <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/gates-foundation-cuts-ties-arabella-advisors-linked-funding-radical-leftist-causes">more than $200 million</a> to the Arabella network...</p>

标题: Feds Order Officers To Ignore Newsom Law Banning Masks

<p><strong>One of California’s top federal prosecutors issued a memo Friday rejecting Gov. <a href="https://headlineusa.com/tag/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom’s</a> law banning both local and federal officers from wearing masks during operations. </strong></p>

<p>Bilal Essayli, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, addressed the memo to federal officers in the district, instructing them to ignore the law and follow federal procedures established by the Constitution and legal precedent.  </p>

<p>He warned that any state official who thwarts federal operations would face prosecution. </p>

<p>“<strong>I direct federal law enforcement to continue to comply with federal law and follow their agency policies on the appropriateness of wearing masks when conducting federal law enforcement operations</strong>,” Essayli wrote in a two-page memo.  </p>

<p>“Any state official or private individual that unlawfully interferes or impedes federal law enforcement operations should be referred to my office for prosecution,” he added. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Essayli’s guidance comes less than a week after Newsom signed SB 627, a controversial law that aims to criminalize facial coverings for law enforcement officers in the Golden State. </p>

<p><strong>The bill — signed Sept. 20 and effective Jan. 1, 2026 — also targets federal immigration agents wearing masks while apprehending criminal illegal aliens. </strong></p>

<p>The Trump administration repeatedly defended the use of masks, saying they are necessary in response to growing threats against federal officers.</p>

<p>Just this week, a gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, killing one detainee and injuring two others. The suspect, 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, allegedly attacked to instill terror among ICE officers. </p>

<p>It remains unclear how Newsom plans to enforce the law. </p>

<p>Essayli said Newsom was “confused” about his constitutional authority in a separate statement on X. </p>

<p>“<strong>He oversees California, not federal agencies. He should review the Supremacy Clause</strong>,” Essayli said. “California’s law to ‘unmask’ federal agents is unconstitutional, as the state lacks jurisdiction to interfere with federal law enforcement.

标题: "We Think Sentiment Will Turn Positive": UBS Sees Inflection Point In Under Armour Shares

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">"We Think Sentiment Will Turn Positive": UBS Sees Inflection Point In Under Armour Shares</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank's <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/under-armour-shares-crash-kevin-planks-turnaround-plan-hits-wall">turnaround effort</a> may have hit a wall this year following the latest earnings report. Reports that he is <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/need-liquidity-under-armour-ceo-kevin-plank-lists-22m-race-horse-farm-ua-near-lows">selling personal assets</a>, including his racehorse farm and his stake in an <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/kevin-plank-sells-luxury-hotel-his-billion-dollar-microcity-turns-ghost-town-amid">exclusive Baltimore hotel</a>, have raised new concerns about Plank's financial health as UA continues to struggle. <strong>However, one UBS analyst sees light at the end of the tunnel,</strong> suggesting that sentiment around the athleisure brand <strong>could finally shift from negative to positive by 2027</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-09-29_14-56-14.png?itok=qIfeDckv"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="501" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-09-29_14-56-14.png?itok=qIfeDckv" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>UA stock is down 34.5% year-to-date as of late Monday's cash trading session in New York. Shares are now trading at 2010 levels, marking a collapse from the 2015 peak and extending what has become a decade-long bear market.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Snag_5fb7a9ce.png?itok=e3h1kQs8"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="273" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Snag_5fb7a9ce.png?itok=e3h1kQs8" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>However, <strong>not everyone believes UA is headed for delisting from the New York Stock Exchange or spiraling into insolvency</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Picture1-52.png?itok=JpDlj4qC"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="487" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Picture1-52.png?itok=JpDlj4qC" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>UBS analyst Jay Sole told clients earlier on Monday:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>We think sentiment will turn positive in FY27, driving stock outperformance</em></strong><em>: </em></p>

<p><em>We believe the Under Armour brand name remains an </em><strong><em>important asset</em></strong><em>, and we expect the company to better leverage it going forward than it has over the past few years. The presentations we saw at our 2nd annual Athletic Training & Lifestyle Innovation Day & 5K reinforce our conviction in this view. While tariffs will likely have a pronounced negative impact on sales and margins in FY26, </em><strong><em>we believe UAA is poised for a strong FY27 turnaround</em></strong><em>. As this inflection takes place, we expect </em><strong><em>sentiment around UAA to flip to positive from negative. This is why we continue to rate UAA Buy.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sole outlined three key takeaways from his meeting with UA executives:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong><em>We think UAA is successfully executing on its innovation plan</em></strong><em>. Last year during our conference, UAA unveiled its Velociti Elite 3 performance running shoe, along with a new fiber technology, dubbed NEOLAST. Since then, Sharon Lokedi won the Boston Marathon in May 2025 and set women's course record, while running in the Velociti Elite 3 shoes. The company plans to launch 3 versions of the Velociti shoe this fall, along with other footwear products over the next year. Plus, at our event this year, UAA showcased the first commercial use-cases of its NEOLAST fiber in new performance tees, which are expected to launch next year.</em></p>

	<p><strong><em>UAA has a solid strategy to "premiumize" the brand</em></strong><em>, in our view. First, the company is tightening its strategic focus on its top 10 or so volume products. This is already in the works with the company's ongoing efforts to reduce its SKU count by 25%. Second, UAA is implementing a tiered product pricing strategy by establishing "good, better, and best" products. For example, UAA mgmt. mentioned the company was over indexed to lower-priced "good" products, given they were significant volume drivers. Under Kevin Plank's leadership, the company plans on introducing more product at higher price points. Importantly, we believe the company's strong upcoming innovation and revamped marketing approach give the brand permission to play in the premium athleticwear market.</em></p>

	<li>
	<p><strong><em>We believe UAA's redefined storytelling will help drive brand heat</em></strong><em>. Mgmt. mentioned the company of the past had missed many opportunities to build greater momentum out of its product innovation due to incohesive brand support. The company now is emphasizing creating compelling storytelling which closely tie its products to the UAA brand. For example, the company presented several upcoming marketing campaigns during our conference which we felt were high impact and clearly conveyed UAA as a leader in sports.</em></p>

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">The Left's Political Playbook: Projection And Deflection</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://amgreatness.com/2025/09/27/the-lefts-political-playbook-projection-and-deflection/"><em>Authored by Thaddeus McCotter via American Greatness,</em></a></p>

<p><em>In hockey, it is routine for a defenseman to project a slap shot from the blue line into a crowd in front of the net. The hope is that his or her teammate’s stick—or, inadvertently, an opponent’s body—will deflect the puck, alter its course, and steer it past a goaltender who is moving in the opposite direction and, thus, has little chance to make a save. While not a fan of soccer (a.k.a. “football”), I suppose this play has its equivalent in other sports, where the kick is projected toward the goal and a teammate “heads” the ball into the net past the flailing goalkeeper.</em></p>

<p><strong>Speaking of projection, deflection, and kicks to the head, this routine maneuver undoubtedly constitutes page one of the left’s political playbook. </strong>The question is whether the right can keep their eye on the puck and prevent the left from firing unfounded shots into the electoral scrum and, abetted by a gaggle of media milling about the goal crease, scoring partisan points and winning elections through projection and deflection.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-09-28_13-03-56.jpg?itok=FPRa82hh"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="278" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-09-28_13-03-56.jpg?itok=FPRa82hh" width="500" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Perhaps the first and foremost instance of leftist deflection and disinformation is the lie that MAGA and, indeed, the entire revitalized Republican Party are “fascists” and/or Nazis. </strong>While this vile deceit is patently ludicrous—and, in many ways, rebounds against those hurling the accusation—what is important to remember is why the left casts this dithyrambic condemnation in the first place: projection and, yes, deflection.</p>

<p>As has often been said, the left accuses its victims of what the left is actually doing.</p>

<p>Consequently, when the left denounces MAGA and the GOP as being “fascists,” they are claiming we have become dangerously enthralled with a destructive foreign ideology. <strong>Yet, the reality is quite the opposite: the Democrats have become dangerously enthralled with a destructive foreign ideology—socialism.</strong></p>

<p>Should one dispense with the left’s projections and deflections, then, the Democrats’ radical drift is patent. Bluntly, the Democrat Party no longer subscribes to the foundational principles of the United States and, alternately, hungers to transmogrify our constitutional republic into a one-party socialist state.</p>

<p><strong>Democrats have an increasing and ominous <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/is-socialism-going-mainstream-a-new-poll-suggests-it-might-be-00564167">acceptance and regard for socialism</a>.</strong> This helps explain the recent rise of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which includes individuals such as U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and New York State Representative and, likely, the next mayor of the Big Apple, Zohran Mamdani, and constitutes the coming of an even more radical sect than the progressives within the overarching Democrat Party. In its very title, the DSA is unashamed of proclaiming the party’s imported European ideology and aims, as well as implicitly broadcasting its members’ elitism and ignorance. This rare burst of truth in advertising is subsumed by the narrative fictions constituting the party’s risible paeans to socialism as a salubrious approach to problem solving and, for that matter, the illusory sheen that “socialism” in 2025 is new and chic—cue: Eugene V. Debs and Stalin—though, in fairness, it could well seem so to those who have never learned the lessons of history or, for that matter, a damn thing about American civics.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding the ignorance of American civics, the Democrats’ progressive wing has a slightly better grasp of the subject than the DSA, but that is only because of the necessity of having a hazy understanding of the foundational American principles they seek to fundamentally transmogrify and destroy.</strong></p>

<p>Ponder the deep thoughtlessness of progressive U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who is living proof that, when it comes to the Senate, while sometimes cream rises to the top, more often sh-t floats. Sen. Kaine apparently <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bishop-robert-barron-dangers-behind-sen-kaines-rejection-god-given-rights-founding-principle">“found troubling” the foundational American principle</a> that every citizen has God-given rights that cannot be infringed and must be protected by government—often from the government—and compared the concept to Iran’s theocratic regime. Called on the regal red carpet, Sen. Kaine “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-tim-kaine-why-americas-rights-depend-laws-not-divine-decrees-religious-authority">clarified</a>” (i.e., “contradicted”) his prior remarks to claim he was only asserting our God-given rights required legal protections to ensure them. Yeah, sure he did.</p>

<p>What both the internally dominant DSA and progressive sects of the Democrat Party reveal is an American political party that aspires to be a radical left-wing European socialist party. You have no constitutional rights a vote cannot infringe and abolish; you have no private property; the language and foundational principles of America are hollowed out, rendering them meaningless or, worse, perverted beyond recognition; and, as we saw during the COVID pandemic and the Obama and Biden administrations’ weaponization of government, we have a dystopian “our democracy” where the secular, one-party-divined civil religion is assiduously enforced and dissent is mercilessly crushed.</p>

<p><strong>So, remember: whenever the left projects and deflects and accuses you of being a “fascist,” they are merely announcing their betrayal of our nation’s unifying foundational principles and their adherence to the alien European concept of socialism. </strong>Like a good goalie, recognize their play, keep your eye on the puck, and make the save of our constitutional republic.</p>
