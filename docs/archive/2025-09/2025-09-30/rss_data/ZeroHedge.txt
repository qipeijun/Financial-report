摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Shutdown Odds Spike After House GOP Refuse To Bring Chamber Into Session: Report</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><strong>Update (11450ET): </strong></em>It seems like everyone wants a shutdown this time. As Democrat leaders are being pressured by a coalition of federal unions to 'hold the line' and fight back against budget cuts to 'critical public services' even if it leads to a shutdown and mass layoffs, <strong>Republicans appear to have called their bluff ahead of a Sept. 1 deadline.</strong></p>

<p>According to <em>Punchbowl News</em>' Jake Sherman, <strong>House Republicans on today's conference call indicated that House and Senate GOP leadership will have a joint <em>news conference</em> Wednesday morning</strong> - the day of the shutdown - and they won't bring the House back into session until next week. </p>

<p>The White House, meanwhile, tells <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/29/congress/leavitt-democrats-reasonable-00584410"><em>Politico</em></a> that President Trump will push congressional Democrats to back a House-passed stopgap bill during an Oval Office sitdown Monday, less than 48 hours before the shutdown. </p>

<p>"Let me be very clear about the president and the White House’s position: All we are asking for is a common-sense, clean funding resolution, a continuing resolution to keep the government open," Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a Monday interview on Fox News. "The president is giving Democrat leadership one last chance to be reasonable, to come to the White House today to try to talk about this," she added.</p>

<p>Yet, <strong>according to Sherman, and <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/us-government-shutdown-by-october-1">Polymarket</a>, a shutdown is in the cards</strong>. </p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/house-senate-leaders-in-shutdown-standoff-ahead-of-meeting-with-trump-5921456">Authored by Jacob Burg via The Epoch Times</a> (emphasis ours),</em></p>

<p><strong>Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are digging their heels in ahead of a critical meeting with President Donald Trump to avoid a potential government shutdown this week</strong>, each pinning the blame for any negotiations that fail tomorrow on the opposing party.</p>

<p>Trump agreed to meet with Senate and House leaders of both parties on Sept. 29 to hopefully broker a deal to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded until a long-term spending bill can be passed.</p>

<p><strong>Democrats say that Republicans need to agree to extend certain tax <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/us/health-care-subsidies-a-sticking-point-in-shutdown-standoff-what-to-know-5920226">subsidies</a> for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace—also known as Obamacare</strong>—that were passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan and are set to expire at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Republicans are countering by saying the tax subsidy discussion can occur after passing a continuing resolution to keep the government afloat in the short term, saying the Affordable Care Act is beset by “waste, fraud, and abuse.”</p>

<p>A government shutdown is “totally up to the Democrats,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sept. 27.</p>

<p>“<strong>The ball is in their court</strong>,” he said. “So this decision, in my judgment, at this point in time, is up to a handful of Democrats. We need eight Democrats to pass it through the Senate, something that 13 times, when the Democrats had the majority over the last four years and President [Joe] Biden was in the White House, Republicans helped Democrats do.”</p>

<p>He said the tax credits don’t expire until the end of the year and that Democrats need to “release the hostage” on refusing to approve the continuing resolution before having that conversation on health care.</p>

<p>“That particular program is desperately in need of reform. It’s fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse, so we are going to have to have reforms if we take action there,” Thune said. “But I think there’s potentially a path forward.”</p>

<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said his coalition has been pushing for a meeting and “real negotiation” with Trump present, saying “we need the president as part of it.”</p>

<p>“<strong>We need Speaker Johnson; let the four leaders and the president sit down,</strong>” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sept. 28, referring to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and the meeting with Trump scheduled for 2 p.m. on Sept. 29.</p>

<p>Schumer said the Democrats are focused on health care.</p>

<p>“Rural hospitals are closing. People are going to get notices of $4,000-a-year increase in their premiums. So our job is to represent the people of America,” he said. “So far, they’ve stonewalled and said we’re not discussing any of that, and we'll see if it changes.”</p>

<p>Johnson said Trump is always open to talks but wants to “operate in good faith, so he decided to bring us all in.”</p>

<p>“He wants to talk with Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and just try to convince them to follow common sense and do what’s right by the American people,” Johnson told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sept. 28. “It’s important to point out the only thing we are trying to do is buy a little time.”</p>

<p><strong>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement that negotiations would hinge on “find[ing] a path forward to actually fix the health care system that Republicans have broken for the good of everyone.”</strong> He was referring to the expiring tax credits and cuts to Medicaid included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year.</p>

<p><strong>Johnson called the statement “absolutely absurd.”</strong></p>

<p>“The [topic of] Obamacare subsidies is a policy debate that has to be determined by the end of the year, Dec. 31,” Johnson said. “Not right now, while we’re simply trying to keep the government open so we can have all these debates.”</p>

<p>CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Johnson about health care experts who have said that Americans’ premiums could increase by as much as 75 percent—as early as October—if the Obamacare subsidies expire without extension, and pressed the House leader if he’s “worried at all that those people might blame Republicans for those health care costs, for the insurance costs going up.”</p>

<p><strong>“No, they’re not being truthful about that</strong>,” Johnson said. “The program doesn’t expire until the end of December, so we have time to have all those discussions and debates.”</p>

标题: Case Closed! Obama CIA Boss John Brennan Clears Himself Of Any Wrongdoing

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Case Closed! Obama CIA Boss John Brennan Clears Himself Of Any Wrongdoing</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em>Authored by <a href="https://headlineusa.com/author/lcornelio">Luis Cornelio</a> via <a href="https://headlineusa.com/subscribe/">Headline USA</a>,</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Embattled former<a href="https://headlineusa.com/tag/cia"> CIA</a> Director<a href="https://headlineusa.com/tag/John-brennan"> John Brennan</a> boasted on MSNBC over the weekend that he investigated himself and found no wrongdoing. </strong></em></p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/brennan-i-stand-very-much-by-the.jpg?itok=kwmikhfa"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="277" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/brennan-i-stand-very-much-by-the.jpg?itok=kwmikhfa" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Brennan made the claims on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBBRuM5snn0">Saturday’s edition of </a><em>The Weekend</em> in response to legacy media reports falsely claiming that DNI Tulsi Gabbard may have hampered the criminal case against him after she revoked the security clearances of potential witnesses. </p>

<p><strong>“I don’t see any case against me. </strong>I have looked back on all of my actions and decisions, and with John Durham, the special counsel, and others that have looked at what we did — they were certainly consistent with our legal authorities and with the law,” Brennan said. </p>

<p>His remarks quickly circulated online, with critics mocking him for seemingly acting as his own judge and jury. In a sarcastic X post that garnered more than one million views, popular page Western Lensman wrote,<strong> “Well, that settles it then.” </strong></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Another account replied that <strong>Brennan “literally became the meme,” </strong>sharing an image captioned: “We’ve investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong.” </p>

<p>A third page added, <em><strong>“‘After careful consideration and examination of the evidence and lack thereof, I hereby find myself… Not guilty.’”</strong></em></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Brennan’s comments come as he faces a criminal investigation into his role in promoting the debunked conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. </p>

<p>The probe was opened at the referral of current CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who found that Brennan may have lied to Congress about the origins of the 2016 investigation into Russian meddling and the role the Steele Dossier played.  </p>

<p><strong>Brennan had long insisted the dossier played only a minor role, but newly declassified documents showed otherwise. </strong></p>

<p>Files previously reported by Headline USA suggest the Obama administration systematically bypassed procedures in a rushed effort to paint Trump as a Russian asset following his election. According to Gabbard, this was carried out at the direction of then-President Barack Obama. </p>

<p>Legacy media <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/24/tulsi-gabbard-undermines-probe-trump-russia">have</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/us/politics/john-brennan-tulsi-gabbard-cia-trump.html">claimed</a> that Gabbard’s actions may have stalled Brennan’s potential prosecution by making key witnesses less willing to participate. Those reports omit, however, that the DOJ can still compel their testimony through subpoenas. </p>

<p>Brennan himself acknowledged this during his MSNBC interview. </p>

<p>“Individuals who used to work in the government, even if their security clearances were revoked, they could be subpoenaed. They could be called to provide testimony in support of whatever allegations they have. I just – I don’t see a case there,” he stated.</p>

标题: Hegseth Sends 200 National Guard Troops Into Portland As Antifa Targets ICE

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Hegseth Sends 200 National Guard Troops Into Portland As Antifa Targets ICE</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>On Sunday, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth <strong>officially deployed the National Guard to Portland</strong>, Oregon, to <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/assets-mobilizing-counter-radical-lefts-campaign-terrorism-against-ice-agents-facilities">counter far-left groups</a> targeting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and facilities. The state of Oregon immediately filed a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment. This move comes as <strong>dark-money-funded leftist NGOs, far-left groups, and radicalized leftist lone wolves resort to violence this year</strong>, with some of this mayhem referred to as "<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-directs-task-force-counter-rogue-ngos-leftist-groups-sowing-chaos" target="_blank">civil terrorism</a>" ... and attacks have intensified this month.</p>

<p>Hegseth wrote in a memo, "<strong>This memorandum further implements the President's directive. 200 members of the Oregon National Guard will be called into Federal service immediately as part of the previously authorized call</strong>." </p>

<p>Then followed the suit by Democrats in Oregon, which named President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and the Department of Defense, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the Department of Homeland Security, as defendants. The <strong>suit asked the federal court in Portland to halt Trump's deployment of troops and declare it unlawful</strong>. </p>

<p>NBC News quoted White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson as saying that <strong>Trump's actions were "lawful"</strong> and that they would "make Portland safer."</p>

<p>"<strong>President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters</strong>," Jackson explained. </p>

<p><strong>Democrats are mobilizing their protest industrial complex, funded by leftist billionaires</strong> and even some foreign entities, to counter the Trump administration and 'America First' agenda.

标题: What's That Weird Smell Coming From Nvidia

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">What's That Weird Smell Coming From Nvidia</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em>Submitted by <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/nvidia-is-starting-to-smell-a-little">QTR's Fringe Finance</a></em></p>

<p>At some point last week, I put down whatever article I was reading about AAA commercial real estate defaults, “Fartcoin”, the subprime auto market imploding, student debt delinquencies skyrocketing, or unaudited stablecoins being threaded into the fabric of the Treasury market to read <em>The Information’s</em> <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/nvidia-is-starting-to-smell-a-little" rel="">piece</a> about Nvidia discussing a new chip-leasing business model with OpenAI.</p>

<p>Familiarizing myself with the details, I could only let out an exhausted sigh.</p>

<p>The general story is that OpenAI could lease GPUs instead of buying them outright, saving an estimated 10 to 15 percent on costs while avoiding heavy capex and depreciation. Nvidia, meanwhile, would keep ownership of the hardware — possibly through a financing vehicle — and turn racks of GPUs into collateral.</p>

<p>On the surface, it sounds like clever financial engineering. But I’ve been doing this long enough — more than a decade as a professional short seller and now as just a general nuisance that writes a column— to know when something doesn’t smell right. And this doesn’t.</p>

<p><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!F7SE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137a2308-1574-4863-ad99-546f5a14a4ee_1326x818.jpeg" rel="" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://www.zerohedge.com/src" /></a></p>

<p>I tend to think businesses don’t reinvent themselves as financiers because things are running smoothly. They do it when customers can’t or won’t keep up with the spending binge, and when management wants to paper over cracks with accounting gymnastics. Or, when an announcement absolutely has to hit the market as a PR before it tangibly takes hold.</p>

<p>We’ve all seen it before: telecom leasebacks in the dot-com era, mortgage-backed securities before 2008, all that bullshit — all sold as “innovation” until the music stopped.</p>

<p>My regular readers know this isn’t the first time Nvidia has set off my radar. Back in September 2023, I wrote a piece called <em>As the Market’s Black Swan Just Arrived?</em> In addition to arguing we were nearing a top because a semiconductor executive was signing tits like he was f*cking Jon Bon Jovi…</p>

<p><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8xrT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05bf0304-ba1f-473a-8444-f66d4f60007f_1496x1232.jpeg" rel="" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://www.zerohedge.com/src" /></a></p>

<p>…I also pointed out the circular economics in Nvidia’s relationship with CoreWeave (first brought to light by people like <a href="https://x.com/SamanthaLaDuc" rel="">Samantha LaDuc</a> and others) — Nvidia investing in a startup that depended on its chips, which then used those very same chips as collateral to borrow money… to buy more Nvidia chips.</p>

<p>My line at the time was: “Nvidia invested in CoreWeave, which is reliant on Nvidia products, and now those Nvidia products are being used as collateral to buy… what is most likely more Nvidia products. Fantastic.”</p>

<p>Fast forward to July 2025, and I then wrote <em>One Tech Stock I’m Hell Bent on Avoiding</em> — again about CoreWeave. CoreWeave’s IPO was so weak there was no real demand at $40. Nvidia had to backstop it with a $250 million “rescue” order just to get it out the door. And then, a few months later, CoreWeave is trading at $120.</p>

<p>Am I really supposed to believe investor demand materialized out of nowhere in that short a time? What <em>rational</em> explanation is there for this? And, more importantly, <em>does anyone even give a f*ck?</em></p>

<p><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8Kvl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ac083c7-fedd-406b-a27c-a265b9f6d5c7_1682x1500.jpeg" rel="" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://www.zerohedge.com/src" /></a></p>

<p>Now, add this past week’s leasing story to that backdrop. It looks like the same playbook: potentially circular economics dressed up as innovation. First with CoreWeave, now with OpenAI.</p>

<p>And the entanglements don’t stop there. Nvidia has been spraying money around the sector. Nvidia has combined strategic investments in partners such as OpenAI, Intel, and ElevenLabs. By my count, in 2025 alone, Nvidia made at least six major moves—three acquisitions (Gretel, Lepton AI, CentML) and three strategic investments (Intel, OpenAI, ElevenLabs). Why spread yourself in so many directions, so quickly? How is it possible to even <em>effectuate </em>these deals and partnerships that feel like they are coming literally every other day?</p>

<p>This would be interesting to watch in any company, but Nvidia isn’t just any company. It’s one of the so-called Magnificent Seven, a stock so heavily weighted in ETFs and indices that nearly every investor — pensions, retirement accounts, mom-and-pop 401(k)s — owns it whether they know it or not.</p>

<hr /><p>Nvidia has become the market’s bellwether, and its success or failure dictates the broader market’s moves. If confidence ever cracks in the name, it won’t just be Nvidia’s stock price that falls — it could destabilize the whole market.</p>

<p>Yes, leasing works in some industries. Aircraft engines are offered “power by the hour.” Software went subscription years ago. But GPUs aren’t aircraft engines or software licenses. They’re fast-depreciating, quickly outdated hardware — made even more so by Nvidia itself, which has shortened its product cycles to one year. Leasing them doesn’t align incentives; it traps customers on a treadmill, while Nvidia squeezes them for rent.</p>

<p>OpenAI’s motive is obvious — it’s likely burning cash and still leaning on Microsoft to keep the lights on. Nvidia’s motive is just as clear: keep the demand story alive at all costs. But when the “innovation” at the center of the AI boom shifts from new chips to new financing gimmicks, I don’t see progress. I see late-cycle behavior.</p>

<p>I’ve said before that I wasn’t sure AI was a bubble. But with CoreWeave’s failed IPO magically tripling in months, with Nvidia underwriting its own customers, and now with this talk of chip leasing, I’ve changed my mind. This is what bubbles look like — distorted incentives, circular economics, and financial engineering that papers over weaknesses.</p>

<p>And when the company carrying the entire market on its back decides its next great idea is lease accounting, that might not just be a red flag. It could be a warning flare.</p>

摘要: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">'Everybody Wants A Deal': Trump Presses Netanyahu On Gaza Peace In 4th WH Visit</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>President Trump is once again hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, in order to mull the US president's Gaza peace proposal amid mounting support among Western nations for Palestinian statehood. It remains that of course neither Washington nor Israel is on board with such recognition, but Trump has wanted to see a swift resolution as the war approaches its two-year mark next week.</p>

<p>This will be Netanyahu's<strong> fourth White House visit </strong>since Trump returned to office in January. Despite the red carpet constantly being rolled out for him in Washington, he faces growing international isolation, especially in Europe.</p>

<p>During his last <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/netanyahu-touts-regime-change-across-middle-east-un-speech-thanks-america">Friday speech</a> before the UN General Assembly in New York, he <strong>lashed out at the leaders of France, Great Britain, Australia, Canada</strong>, and other countries for "unconditionally" recognizing a Palestinian state. At the same time he thanked America for its firm pro-Israel stance.</p>

<p>But Trump is optimistic that a deal with Hamas to secure the release of all hostages can be salvaged. He told <em>Reuters</em> on Sunday that he hopes to gain Netanyahu's support for a peace framework that would end the conflict in Gaza. "We're getting a very good response because Bibi wants to make the deal too," Trump said in a phone interview. <strong>"Everybody wants to make the deal."</strong></p>

<p>Regional powers have reportedly been involved, including including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, and Egypt - in planning and backing the agreement, which is crucial for its chances of success.</p>

<p>"It’s called peace in the Middle East - more than Gaza. Gaza is part of it, but it’s peace in the Middle East," Trump said. Per the published schedule for <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahus-white-house-visit-to-include-lunch-meeting-press-conference/">Monday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The meeting is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. local time (6 p.m. in Israel), when Trump will greet Netanyahu, according to the itinerary. The two men will then hold a meeting and sit for a meal together, followed by the press conference, scheduled for 1:15 p.m.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has previewed to reporters that <strong>"both sides have to give up a little bit and might leave the table a little bit unhappy</strong>.<strong>" </strong>But it seems this conversation is only being had with one side, given no signs of direct Hamas involvement in these discussions. </p>

<p>The reality is that this month's Israeli attack on Hamas officials in Doha was likely the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of ending the possibility of negotiations. Hamas says its negotiating team was lured to Qatar precisely with the promise of a new deal on the horizon, only to be attacked in a brazen Israeli operation, leaving five dead, as as well as a Qatari security guard.</p>

<p>So despite Trump's optimism for the future, <strong>chances aren't great</strong>, also at a time the IDF is pursuing the total takeover of Gaza City.</p>

<p><strong>Hamas has meanwhile made clear that it won't negotiate its own demise</strong>, while also wanting a full Israeli military withdrawal before all remaining hostages are released, but Netanyahu is still pledging to not end IDF operations until the complete eradication of Hamas is realized.</p>

<p>Trump reportedly wants to see an immediate halt to all military operations, but will Israel comply? Will Hamas comply? Both seem remain locked in a <strong>zero sum fight</strong> at this point, so it seems increasingly unlikely.</p>

<p>Earlier, we previewed the president's <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/trumps-21-point-plan-ending-gaza-war-revealed-first-time">21-point plan for ending the Gaza war</a>, which was first revealed over the weekend in Israeli media sources.</p>
