<p>“<strong>Let your rage fuel you.</strong>” Those words from Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee <a href="https://thehill.com/people/abigail-spanberger/">Abigail Spanberger </a>captured what I have called “rage politics” in America.</p>

<p><a href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gPIJ6GYrQwCfSAinBrIESw-e1759074290137_jpg_92.jpg?itok=7ohEALhz"><img alt="" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" height="375" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gPIJ6GYrQwCfSAinBrIESw-e1759074290137_jpg_92.jpg?itok=7ohEALhz" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Across the country, politicians and pundits are fueling rage, encouraging voters to embrace it. If you turn on the television, you would think that Darth Sidious had taken over: “<strong>Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you grow stronger</strong>.”</p>

<p>I do not think for a second that Spanberger supports violence. She was sharing with voters the “sage advice” of her mother, which she said she has applied in her political career. However, the anger is all around us.</p>

<p><strong>Recently, I <a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2025/09/23/the-turley-klarman-debate-a-video-and-a-response/">debated </a>Harvard Law Professor Michael Klarman, who declared, “I am very angry” and “I am enraged.”</strong> In denouncing ICE as “thugs” and saying Trump supporters are “fascists,” Klarman explained that the rage had a purpose: “to shake people out of their insomnia.”</p>

<p>Rage, however, comes at a cost in politics. I recently wrote a book about rage and free speech, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Indispensable-Right/Jonathan-Turley/9781668047040">The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage</a>.”<em> </em>It discusses our history of rage politics and how it has led to violence and crackdowns. Rage gives people a license to say and do things that they would not otherwise say or do. It is addictive, it is contagious, and it is dangerous.</p>

<p>We are seeing the result of rage rhetoric all around us. <strong>That includes the assassination of <a href="https://thehill.com/people/charlie-kirk/">Charlie Kirk </a>and the sniper attack on ICE agents in Texas this week, in addition to violent protests around the country.</strong></p>

<p>Rage allows you to deny the humanity of those you disagree with. Recently, two sisters were caught on video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4yiuWvCsSA">destroying a memorial</a> to Kirk. Kerri and Kaylee Rollo were later arrested. However, they immediately opened a GoFundMe site to call for donations for “fighting fascism” and Kaylee wrote “my sibling was fired from their job.” Hundreds of donors gave the sisters thousands of dollars as a reward for the latest such attack on a Kirk memorial.</p>

<p>For many months, some of us have warned that violent rhetoric was crossing over into political violence. Democratic politicians have spent months ratcheting up the rhetoric against ICE agents, who have suffered more than a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/22/despite-1000-increase-assaults-ice-officers-governor-newsom-signs-unconstitutional">1,000 percent</a> <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/22/despite-1000-increase-assaults-ice-officers-governor-newsom-signs-unconstitutional">increase</a> in attacks, including the recent sniper attack.</p>

<p><strong>Gov. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gavin-newsom/">Gavin Newsom </a>(D), the day before that attack, signed a law that purports to bar ICE agents from wearing masks in California. He openly mocked them, asking, “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-silent-anti-ice-rhetoric-after-dallas-shooting-despite-urging-nonviolence">What are you afraid of?</a>“</strong></p>

<p><strong>Joshua Jahn <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-joshua-jahn-shooter-deadly-dallas-ice-facility-attack">answered that question</a> the following day in Texas when he fired at ICE personnel, only to shoot three of their detainees.</strong></p>

<p>Previously, Newsom had warned voters that Trump was building ICE into a personal army that might be used to suppress voting in the upcoming midterm elections. “Do you think ICE is not going to show up around voting and polling booths to chill participation?” he said.</p>

<p>Others added to the rage rhetoric by declaring the impending death of democracy and lashing out at ICE. Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jasmine-crockett/">Jasmine Crockett </a>(D-Texas), who has used violent rhetoric in the past, declared that ICE agents were acting like “slave patrols” in hunting down immigrants in the streets.</p>

<p>Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/tim-walz/">Tim Walz </a>(D) used a commencement address to denounce “<a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/">Donald Trump’s </a>modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets. They’re in unmarked vans, wearing masks, being shipped off to foreign torture dungeons… just grabbed up by masked agents, shoved into those vans, and disappeared.”</p>

<p><strong>Others, like Boston Mayor Michele Wu, echoed the claims that ICE personnel are “Nazis” and called ICE Trump’s “secret police.”</strong></p>

<p>The rage rhetoric (and claims of a fascist takeover) has been adopted by a wide range of Democratic politicians, often using the same catchphrases of an “authoritarian playbook.” In our debate, Professor Klarman warned that this was all “authoritarianism rooted in old-fashioned white supremacy.”</p>

<p>As discussed in my book, politicians and pundits have long sought to ride the wave of rage into power or influence. Rage is a powerful narcotic. The problem is when it becomes an addiction. There is always a certain percentage of the population that will believe such hyperbolic claims.</p>

<p>Those are the people who end up trying to kill jurists like Justice <a href="https://thehill.com/people/brett-kavanaugh/">Brett Kavanaugh </a>or politicians like Trump. It was also seen in the assassination of Democratic politicians earlier this year in Minnesota.</p>

<p>With the recent assassination and attacks on ICE, some are expressing regret. One of the most telling was Hillary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/clinton/">Clinton </a>on MSNBC, who said that we should “stop demonizing each other” while blaming “the right” for most of the hate. It was a curious call from a woman who called Trump supporters “deplorables” and suggested that they should collectively be forced into “deprogramming” as a cult. Just before the interview, Clinton had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-sparks-social-media-firestorm-promoting-book-warning-about-fascists-sick-people">embraced the “fascism” mantra</a> and, during the interview, she went right back to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/hillary-clinton-warns-against-finger-pointing-seconds-after-blaming-the-right-for-tense-political-climate/">attacking Republicans</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5520112-survey-political-crisis-in-us/">new poll</a> shows that 71 percent view political violence as a serious problem, but the rage rhetoric continues unabated.</strong></p>

<p>The perfunctory calls for lowering the temperature after the latest shooting are unlikely to last. Key figures in public life keep injecting rage directly into the veins of American politics. It is hard to go “cold turkey” in breaking that addiction, but you first have to want to do so. There is no indication that our rage-addicts are anywhere near a step-program for recovery. If history is any measure, this fever will only break when voters clearly reject the politics of rage.</p>
