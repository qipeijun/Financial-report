Summary: <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Hegseth Sends 200 National Guard Troops Into Portland As Antifa Targets ICE</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>On Sunday, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth <strong>officially deployed the National Guard to Portland</strong>, Oregon, to <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/assets-mobilizing-counter-radical-lefts-campaign-terrorism-against-ice-agents-facilities">counter far-left groups</a> targeting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and facilities. The state of Oregon immediately filed a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment. This move comes as <strong>dark-money-funded leftist NGOs, far-left groups, and radicalized leftist lone wolves resort to violence this year</strong>, with some of this mayhem referred to as "<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-directs-task-force-counter-rogue-ngos-leftist-groups-sowing-chaos" target="_blank">civil terrorism</a>" ... and attacks have intensified this month.</p>

<p>Hegseth wrote in a memo, "<strong>This memorandum further implements the President's directive. 200 members of the Oregon National Guard will be called into Federal service immediately as part of the previously authorized call</strong>." </p>

<p>Then followed the suit by Democrats in Oregon, which named President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and the Department of Defense, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the Department of Homeland Security, as defendants. The <strong>suit asked the federal court in Portland to halt Trump's deployment of troops and declare it unlawful</strong>. </p>

<p>NBC News quoted White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson as saying that <strong>Trump's actions were "lawful"</strong> and that they would "make Portland safer."</p>

<p>"<strong>President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters</strong>," Jackson explained. </p>

<p>Earlier, <strong>leftist Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek was spotted leading the "50501" movement, part of the Democratic Party's protest industrial complex funded by dark-money NGOs and leftist billionaires</strong>. These rogue NGOs orchestrated and spread chaos nationwide earlier this year and throughout the summer via color revolution-style operations, with many of the protests/riots directed at Trump and Elon Musk.</p>

<p><strong>Democrats are mobilizing their protest industrial complex, funded by leftist billionaires</strong> and even some foreign entities, to counter the Trump administration and 'America First' agenda. Many of these dark networks are now under federal investigation as the White House takes an all-of-government approach to counter political violence emanating from Democrats. </p>

<p>Last week, a New York Times report revealed that Soros' Open Society Foundation funneled <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/new-report-reveals-soros-open-society-funneled-80-million-pro-terror-groups">$80 million into pro-terror groups</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="http://mayor">China-linked Marxist tycoon</a> Neville Roy Singham is also under investigation for financing chaos, as Antifa and other radical left groups openly declare war on Trump. </p>

</ul><p><strong>This isn't your parents' Democratic Party</strong>; it's an elitist political machine that <strong>bankrolls organized violence, hate, and socialism/Marxism</strong>, with the ultimate aim of overthrowing Trump and dismantling the nation for a socialist reconstruction.
