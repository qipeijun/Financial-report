            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Part of the Democratic Party's dark-money, billionaire-funded NGO network has repositioned its activist groups to unleash a campaign that mobilizes left-wing voters to mount a full-blown pressure campaign against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democratic senators not to concede to President Trump, thereby voting against government funding and triggering a partial shutdown. </p>

<p>"<strong>CALL NOW: Tell Your Democratic Senator(s) to Make Sure Schumer Doesn't Hand Trump a Blank Check</strong>," far-left activist group Indivisible wrote on its website. </p>

<p>In a recent ZeroHedge NGO money-mapping report, <a href="https://x.com/peterschweizer">Peter Schweizer</a> and <a href="https://x.com/seamusbruner">Seamus Bruner</a> of the <a href="https://x.com/Govt_Acct_Inst">Government Accountability Institute</a> (GAI) exposed that the Indivisible Project (<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/dark-money-network-funneled-millions-no-kings-nationwide-color-revolution-operation">read report</a>), the official organizer of the "No Kings" protest, has received millions of dollars in funding from the Arabella Advisors network. This web of dark-money NGOs bankrolls the protest industrial complex that has waged continuous war on President Trump, the 'America First' agenda, and by extension, all of the president's supporters nationwide. </p>

<p>Indivisible continued in the call to action to Democrats:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Federal government funding runs out on September 30—and Republicans need Democratic votes to clear the filibuster and avoid a government shutdown. Democrats have a strong hand to play. They must use it to deny Donald Trump the blank check Republicans want to hand him!</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>But in the last big funding fight, Chuck Schumer and a handful of other Dems surrendered—rolling over and letting Trump weaponize federal funds to rob our services, militarize our cities, and terrorize our communities. That cannot happen again.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Use this form to call your Democratic senator(s). Remind them we cannot hand blank checks to a wannabe king—and ask them to keep publicly pressuring  Schumer to FIGHT LIKE HELL!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Readers may recall that the Arabella network has been in the news, including in an unlikely outlet: The New York Times (<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/gates-foundation-cuts-ties-arabella-advisors-linked-funding-radical-leftist-causes">read report).</a> In August, the paper reported that the Gates Foundation abruptly halted funding for leftist nonprofit funds managed by the Arabella empire in late June. </p>

<p>GAI's Schweizer and Bruner revealed that the Gates Foundation has funneled <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/gates-foundation-cuts-ties-arabella-advisors-linked-funding-radical-leftist-causes">more than $200 million</a> to the Arabella network...</p>
