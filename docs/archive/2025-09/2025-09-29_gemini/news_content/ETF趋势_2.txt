**Title:** The New Old Regime | WisdomTree

**Key Takeaway (FaST - Few Sentence Takeaway):** President Trump's suggestion of new sanctions/tariffs, particularly on Russian oil, has brought headlines about Russian oil sanctions and NATO participation. A mechanism for executing such a plan already exists, making the implementation of these sanctions relatively easy.[1]

**Summary of the Article:**
The article discusses the potential for new sanctions and tariffs, particularly targeting China for its support of Russia's war efforts, and the role of NATO as a "coalition of the willing."[1] It highlights that this is not a new policy but rather a continuation of previously telegraphed intentions, with some notable pivots, such as India not being singled out.[1]

A significant part of the discussion revolves around the Price Cap Coalition (PCC), which was established to limit the price of Russian oil while ensuring market supply.[1] The PCC initially set a flat price cap of $60 per barrel, primarily enforced through the insurance channel, and it appears to have been effective in capping the price of Russian crude.[1] The Europeans even lowered the calculation earlier this year to a "floating cap" at -15% of the trailing six months, which is currently less than $50.[1] The Bank of Finland noted on September 8, 2025, that the EU's new price cap mechanism, effective September 3, lowered the cap price to $47.60 a barrel, with the UK also adopting a similar floating cap.[1] This move by European countries to unilaterally lower the price cap is seen as a significant signal, especially given that the PCC is essentially NATO.[1]

The article suggests that the Trump Administration's chosen route to pressure Russia is oil, with China being a politically palatable target due to its integral role in the Russian war effort.[1] The existing PCC framework, with NATO as the "coalition of the willing," provides a mechanism to punish Russia by lowering its oil exports.[1] The author speculates that the opening gambit in negotiations with the Trump Administration is typically not the final one, and Europeans might propose a "CPP with sanctions/tariffs for violators," where buying over the price cap incurs sanctions.[1] The cap could even be set prohibitively low, such as $40.[1]

The article also touches upon Russia resorting to barter to continue trade, as Chinese banks are increasingly wary of sanctions.[1] Examples include Chinese cars being traded for Russian wheat, reminiscent of Lada cars being bartered for Coca-Cola in the 1980s and 1990s.[1]

In conclusion, the article states that while there is much "noise," the signals are straightforward: the target is Russia and the war in Ukraine, and the mechanism is oil.[1] The ultimate outcome is subject to debate, but it is not necessarily positive for oil prices and is "doable."[1]
