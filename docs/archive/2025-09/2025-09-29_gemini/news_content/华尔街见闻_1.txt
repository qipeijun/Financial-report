The article discusses how Wall Street is looking beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Mag 7) for AI investment opportunities, as the AI theme expands to a broader range of companies. While the "Mag 7" still holds significant weight in the S&P 500, there's a growing differentiation within the group, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft seen as AI beneficiaries, while Apple, Amazon, and Tesla face uncertainties[1].

New market leaders like Broadcom, Oracle, and Palantir are emerging in the AI space. Oracle's stock has risen over 75% this year, and Palantir has seen a 135% increase, making it the best performer in the Nasdaq 100 index[1].

Wall Street is proposing new stock combinations such as "Big Six," "Elite 8," and "Magnificent 10" to better capture the true AI winners. The Chicago Board Options Exchange even launched a "Magnificent 10" index, which includes the original seven companies plus Broadcom, Palantir, and AMD[1].

The article highlights that the AI investment theme has expanded beyond the traditional "Mag 7" to include companies like TSMC, Arista Networks, and Micron Technology, which benefit from AI infrastructure development[1].
