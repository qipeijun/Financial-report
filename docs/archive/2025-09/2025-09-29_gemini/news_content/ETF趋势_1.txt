The green bond market faced challenges in 2025 due to rate volatility, ideological pushbacks, and climate challenges, leading to a 32% year-over-year decline in global green bond issuance[1]. Despite this, the energy transition continues, with twice as much invested in renewable energy than fossil fuels in 2024, and 93% of new power coming from green sources[1].

USD-denominated green bonds constitute a significant portion of the global market, accounting for 28% of cumulative global issuance through July 2025[1]. U.S. issuers contribute over 50% of this, primarily from corporations and government-backed entities[1]. While USD green bond issuance saw a sharp decrease in 2025, some issuers may be opting for non-green labeled bonds for similar projects while awaiting clearer climate policy[1].

Key observations for 2025 include a shift in energy transition leadership to China, with emerging markets increasingly driving USD issuance[1]. Data centers have become a dominant theme in USD green bonds, fueled by AI's demand for energy-efficient infrastructure[1]. Over 60% of 2025 USD green bonds were benchmark-sized ($500M+), enhancing liquidity and institutional appeal[1]. The Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) and supranational bonds from entities like the World Bank also continue to support the USD green bond supply[1].
