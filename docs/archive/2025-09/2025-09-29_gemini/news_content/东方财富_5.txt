Key points from the article:
*   **Merger Approval:** Hangzhou Hailianxun Technology Co., Ltd. (海联讯) has received approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to absorb and merge with Hangzhou Steam Turbine Power Group Co., Ltd. (杭汽轮B). The approval was issued on September 26, 2025.
*   **Details:** Hailianxun will issue an additional 1.175 billion shares to absorb Hangqilun B.
*   **Background:** Both companies are controlled by the Hangzhou State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. This is described as a "snake swallowing elephant" transaction due to Hangqilun B's significantly larger revenue and net profit compared to Hailianxun.

*   **Rationale:** The merger aims to overcome Hailianxun's development bottlenecks, expand its business, improve its performance, and address Hangqilun B's "B-share dilemma" (low valuation, low trading volume, lack of financing).
*   **Share Exchange:** The share exchange ratio remains 1:1. After profit distributions, both companies' share exchange prices will be adjusted to 9.35 yuan/share.
*   **Outcome:** After the merger, Hangqilun B will be delisted and its legal entity will be canceled.
