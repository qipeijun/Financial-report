**Article Summary:**

Horizon Robotics (09660.HK) has once again initiated a "blood transfusion" mode. On September 26, Horizon announced its plan to place over 600 million shares at HK$9.99 per share, raising approximately HK$6.34 billion (about RMB 5.8 billion).

This marks Horizon's third fundraising within a year, following its Hong Kong IPO in October 2024 which raised HK$5.87 billion, and a placement in June that raised HK$4.67 billion. The total accumulated fundraising exceeds HK$16.8 billion.

Behind the frequent fundraising is Horizon's continuous losses and an unprecedented aggressive bet on the Robotaxi sector. Half a month before the fundraising announcement, Horizon signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Hello Travel, announcing a joint development of Robotaxi using a "technology base company + operator" model, aiming for mass production of pre-installed models by 2026 and deployment of over 50,000 vehicles by 2027.

**Key points from the article:**

*   **Frequent Fundraising:** Horizon Robotics has raised over HK$16.8 billion in three rounds within a year (IPO in Oct 2024, placement in June, and another placement in Sept 2025).
*   **Share Price Impact:** The latest placement price of HK$9.99 was at a discount to the previous day's closing price, leading to a further 8.49% drop in Horizon's stock price to HK$9.7 on September 26.
*   **Use of Funds:** The funds will primarily be used for expanding overseas markets, investing in R&D for mid-to-high-end assisted driving solutions, investing in emerging fields like Robotaxi, and strategic investments in upstream and downstream partners.
*   **Financial Performance:** Despite rapid revenue growth, Horizon has consistently incurred significant losses: RMB 2.064 billion (2021), RMB 8.72 billion (2022), RMB 6.739 billion (2023), totaling over RMB 17.5 billion in three years. Even with a reported profit in 2024 (RMB 2.347 billion), this was mainly due to fair value changes of financial liabilities; the adjusted net loss for 2024 was RMB 1.681 billion. For H1 2025, revenue was RMB 1.567 billion (up 67.6%), but losses expanded to RMB 5.233 billion, with adjusted operating loss at RMB 1.111 billion.
*   **High R&D and Sales Costs:** In H1 2025, R&D expenses increased by 62% to RMB 2.3 billion, and sales & marketing expenses increased by 37.1% to RMB 272 million, together far exceeding revenue.
*   **Bet on Robotaxi:** Horizon is making a significant bet on Robotaxi, with founder Yu Kai believing in a "technology turning point." Market forecasts predict a substantial Robotaxi market in China by the 2030s.
*   **Technology & Product Maturity:** Horizon's Journey series chips have shipped over 10 million units, and its latest HSD system uses an end-to-end algorithm. The Starway ET5, featuring Horizon's Journey 6P and HSD urban assisted driving system, is set to launch in November 2025.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Customer Concentration:** In H1 2025, the top five customers accounted for 52.48% of revenue, with the largest customer at 19.7%. This concentration has been consistently over 50% since 2021.
    *   **Automaker Self-Development:** Car manufacturers are increasingly developing their own chips, squeezing Horizon's market share.
    *   **Partnership with Hello Travel:** Horizon is partnering with Hello Travel (which recently entered the Robotaxi space) as the "technology base company" while Hello acts as the "operator." This model might have hidden risks, as Hello's current approach is seen as "system integration" rather than full-chain independent R&D.
    *   **Overseas Expansion Challenges:** Expanding overseas faces competition from established players like Nvidia and Mobileye, as well as US export restrictions on high-computing power chips.
    *   **Robotaxi Market Uncertainty:** The Robotaxi market has yet to see a truly successful company, with even Tesla's FSD facing lawsuits and Baidu's approach being re-evaluated. Regulators are also warning about risks in intelligent driving.
