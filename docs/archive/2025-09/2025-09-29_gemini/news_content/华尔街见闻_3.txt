The article, based on Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett's latest report, discusses two main points:

1.  **AI Bubble Status:** Hartnett believes that the AI-driven tech stock rally has not yet reached dangerous levels, citing that the credit default swap spreads for tech stocks are at an 18-year low. This indicates that the credit market does not perceive significant default risk for tech companies, contrasting with typical late-stage asset bubbles.
2.  **Dollar Rebound Risk:** The primary risk to the market is not a bubble burst, but an unexpected strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Hartnett notes that the depreciation of the dollar has been a core driver of the current asset price rally (including gold, cryptocurrencies, and stocks). He warns that if the dollar index "disorderly" rebounds and breaks above 102, it could trigger a "risk-off" liquidation of consensus trades, particularly the "short dollar" position.

Despite the short-term dollar rebound risk, Hartnett suggests that the long-term trend of massive government debt and continuous currency devaluation remains, providing structural support for assets like gold. He also mentions that gold, while tactically "overbought," is structurally "under-allocated" in private and institutional client portfolios.
