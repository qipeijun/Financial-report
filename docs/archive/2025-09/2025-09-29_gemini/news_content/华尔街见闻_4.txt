The article discusses how warnings from Federal Reserve chairs about stock market valuations, from Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" to Powell's recent comments on "quite high valuations," have historically had a limited impact on the market.

Key points from the JPMorgan analysis cited in the article:
*   **Limited Market Impact:** Historically, S&P 500 has not seen negative returns in the 1, 6, or 12 months following a Fed chair's valuation warning since 1996.
*   **Slower but Positive Growth:** On average, the 12-month positive returns after a warning were slightly lower than the 6 months prior, indicating a slowdown in market growth but still an upward trend.
*   **Historical Warnings:** Examples include Greenspan (1996), Bernanke (2013), Yellen (2014, 2015), and Powell (during the pandemic and recently). Most warnings occurred during periods of loose monetary policy.
*   **Market Reaction Patterns:** Immediate impact is mild, with slight positive returns for S&P 500 in the first month. Market growth slows but remains resilient. US stocks often outperform international markets after warnings (with some exceptions).
*   **Valuation Assessment:** Broad valuation assessments often overlook changes in industry composition and structural breakthroughs like AI. Stock performance is primarily driven by earnings improvement, not valuation expansion, after warnings.
*   **Macro Weakness as a Catalyst:** JPMorgan suggests that while high valuations and market concentration exist, current growth stock valuations are built on solid fundamentals (strong double-digit organic growth, robust profit margins, capital returns to shareholders). Therefore, high valuations alone are unlikely to trigger a significant market correction. A significant market downturn is more likely to be caused by macroeconomic weakness, such as a deteriorating labor market.
*   **Outlook:** JPMorgan anticipates a market rebound by 2026, supported by an expanding AI investment cycle, robust capital expenditure, accommodative monetary policy, and strong balance sheets in household and corporate sectors.
