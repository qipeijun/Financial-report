The article "This Corporate Bond ETF Matters Now" from ETF Trends discusses the Neuberger Berman Flexible Credit Income ETF (NBFC) as an enticing option for income investors. The article, published on September 26, 2025, highlights that both high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt have performed well, with the two largest ETFs in these categories up an average of 7% year-to-date as of that date[1].

NBFC is an actively managed ETF that launched in June 2024 and invests in a mix of investment-grade and junk debt, with a heavier lean towards the latter. It boasts a 30-day SEC yield of 6.39%[1]. The article notes that investment-grade corporate bonds are currently offering higher-than-average yields, with intermediate-term maturities yielding between 4.25% and 5.50%, according to Charles Schwab[1]. The article suggests that the elevated yield of NBFC implies potential for increasing value in its holdings[1]. It also mentions that current yields on investment-grade corporate bonds can be good indicators of future total returns, making them appealing for investors concerned about the future path of interest rates[1].
