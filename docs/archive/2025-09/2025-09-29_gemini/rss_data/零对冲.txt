Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are digging their heels in ahead of a critical meeting with President Donald Trump to avoid a potential government shutdown this week, each pinning the blame for any negotiations that fail tomorrow on the opposing party.

(L–R) House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) listen during a Hanukkah reception at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington on Dec. 17, 2024. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Trump agreed to meet with Senate and House leaders of both parties on Sept. 29 to hopefully broker a deal to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded until a long-term spending bill can be passed.

Democrats say that Republicans need to agree to extend certain tax subsidies for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace—also known as Obamacare—that were passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan and are set to expire at the end of the year.

Republicans are countering by saying the tax subsidy discussion can occur after passing a continuing resolution to keep the government afloat in the short term, saying the Affordable Care Act is beset by “waste, fraud, and abuse.”

A government shutdown is “totally up to the Democrats,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sept. 27.

“The ball is in their court,” he said. “So this decision, in my judgment, at this point in time, is up to a handful of Democrats. We need eight Democrats to pass it through the Senate, something that 13 times, when the Democrats had the majority over the last four years and President [Joe] Biden was in the White House, Republicans helped Democrats do.”

He said the tax credits don’t expire until the end of the year and that Democrats need to “release the hostage” on refusing to approve the continuing resolution before having that conversation on health care.

“That particular program is desperately in need of reform. It’s fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse, so we are going to have to have reforms if we take action there,” Thune said. “But I think there’s potentially a path forward.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said his coalition has been pushing for a meeting and “real negotiation” with Trump present, saying “we need the president as part of it.”

“We need Speaker Johnson; let the four leaders and the president sit down,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sept. 28, referring to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and the meeting with Trump scheduled for 2 p.m. on Sept. 29.

Schumer said the Democrats are focused on health care.

“Rural hospitals are closing. People are going to get notices of $4,000-a-year increase in their premiums. So our job is to represent the people of America,” he said. “So far, they’ve stonewalled and said we’re not discussing any of that, and we'll see if it changes.”

Johnson said Trump is always open to talks but wants to “operate in good faith, so he decided to bring us all in.”

“He wants to talk with Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and just try to convince them to follow common sense and do what’s right by the American people,” Johnson told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sept. 28. “It’s important to point out the only thing we are trying to do is buy a little time.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement that negotiations would hinge on “find[ing] a path forward to actually fix the health care system that Republicans have broken for the good of everyone.” He was referring to the expiring tax credits and cuts to Medicaid included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year.

Johnson called the statement “absolutely absurd.”

“The [topic of] Obamacare subsidies is a policy debate that has to be determined by the end of the year, Dec. 31,” Johnson said. “Not right now, while we’re simply trying to keep the government open so we can have all these debates.”

CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Johnson about health care experts who have said that Americans’ premiums could increase by as much as 75 percent—as early as October—if the Obamacare subsidies expire without extension, and pressed the House leader if he’s “worried at all that those people might blame Republicans for those health care costs, for the insurance costs going up.”

“No, they’re not being truthful about that,” Johnson said. “The program doesn’t expire until the end of December, so we have time to have all those discussions and debates.”

According to experts, the best way to maintain a new habit is to track it. I’ve recently taken up running. And as runners typically do, I’m now hooked on tracking my distance, measuring my pace, and setting goals to get better. Naturally, this sent me down the rabbit hole of finding the best tracking device.

Custom image by FEE There are many options. From Fitbit to Apple Watch to Garmin, there’s a wide variety of gadgets to monitor our habits. Especially since it’s a growing market. According to Yahoo Finance, the global fitness tracker market was valued at $52.29 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $189.98 billion by 2032, growing 17.5 percent every year from 2026 to 2032. Looks like more and more people are interested in quantifying our health.

Beyond smartwatches, there are also rings. Oura, a Finnish company, pioneered data tracking 10 years ago through a smart ring. The design is unobtrusive, and yet it has the capacity to measure all kinds of information, of course, at a price. To access its full power, you need to pay $349 for the ring plus a $6 monthly subscription.

The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Oura is “the leading smart-ring brand, with over 60 percent of the market,” representing 5 million rings sold worldwide.

Oura and its competitors Ringcon and Ultrahuman have become popular for rings with nice aesthetics as well as a good capacity to track steps, heart rate, sleep cycles, and even menstrual health. But competition will be no more: earlier this year, the International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled against Ultrahuman and Ringcon for patent infringement, effectively banning them from import and sales in the U.S. market starting Oct. 21.

These rings may be less benign than they seem. On Aug. 27, Oura sent out a press release announcing a partnership with the Department of Defense (now unofficially renamed Department of War) and Palantir’s FedStart platform to support “population-level analysis of risk and readiness.” Whatever that means. This triggered all kinds of online backlash over privacy concerns.

Oura CEO Tom Hale said that the company does not and “would never sell customer data.” That has not stopped users from literally trashing their $349 smart rings. Privacy concerns, even if exaggerated by social media, should not be dismissed.

On the one hand, private companies profit from collecting data, but only if consumers willingly participate. If users feel betrayed, we cancel our subscriptions, delete the apps, and move on. That’s the market feedback loop. But it looks like the concern isn’t really about the companies but the possibility of the government accessing this private health data.

We’ve seen what this looks like in countries where the state is more overarching. In China, health surveillance is routine, and health data has become a tool for social control, especially after COVID. There’s a growing concern over the data leviathan wherein the alliance of tech companies and the state enables “social governance” in what some are naming a new era of “digital authoritarianism.”

Science fiction, the art of “what ifs,” has long warned us of this. Some might remember Gattaca, where genetic information dictates social status. What appeared as a futuristic dystopia is getting closer to home. Cutting through the noise of social media, it seems like there’s a legitimate fear.

To be fair, most of us are already handing over vast amounts of personal information. Amazon knows our purchase patterns, Instagram holds our photos, and Google tracks nearly everything in between. It’s quite possible the government is aware of all of this. It’s not as if avoiding a smart ring or a fitness tracker puts us “off the grid.” The difference is one of intimacy: we’re measuring our sleep cycles, stress levels, physical recoveries—it’s the literal state of our bodies.

While concerns might be overblown on social media, it does warrant the question: Should we be more careful and intentional about who we are sharing our sensitive data with?

Granted, no one is forcing us to purchase these devices, but what’s concerning is how little thought is put into the amount of information we are willingly giving to tech companies, especially if it comes in a cute ring that goes with everyday lifestyle, but even more, whether or not there’s a government overreach and how they might use the info.

In the meantime, I’ll keep running and tracking “manually,” and because I bring my phone with me, I’ll be sharing my health info with Apple (and Strava for my two friends who cheer me on, even though, as FEE’s Editorial Director pointed out a few months ago, it’s leaking information). Until then, please read the terms and conditions. We might be feeding the machines & co. more information than we should. It’s not about what we’re tracking; in reality, it’s about who is tracking us.

California, already home to the highest gasoline prices in the U.S., is now bracing for another seasonal surge. The state’s energy regulator has cautioned gasoline traders that it is monitoring the market closely as refinery maintenance squeezes supplies.

In a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom last week, the Division of Petroleum Market Oversight pointed to both planned and unexpected refinery outages, noting that such disruptions are common in autumn—and that sharp price increases also hit in 2022 and 2023, Bloomberg reported this week. 

Average prices at California pumps reached $4.66 per gallon on Tuesday, $1.48 above the national average. The state’s unique fuel blends, required under strict environmental rules, make it harder to secure alternative supplies when local refineries shut down. Over time, the industry has also reduced capacity in California, further tightening the market.

So concerned are policymakers about another shortage that they’ve shifted their approach to oil refiners. Newsom, typically a critic of the industry, delayed implementation of a law he championed to cap refining profits. Legislators even debated offering hundreds of millions of dollars to keep a refinery from closing—once an unthinkable step.

Bloomberg writes that while state leaders ease pressure on refiners, traders face heightened scrutiny. Oversight division director Tai Milder reminded them last week that the state “monitors the spot market daily for misconduct.” He warned that “anyone making purchases that drive fuel prices up, while also holding long positions they subsequently cash in on, will face scrutiny.”

California’s fuel market is thinly traded and heavily reliant on voluntary price reporting, making it vulnerable to manipulation. The state has also shown it is willing to act: in 2020, the attorney general sued Vitol Inc. and SK Energy Americas Inc. for manipulating the gasoline market during a 2015 spike. That case ended with a $50 million settlement last year.

Tyler Durden Sun, 09/28/2025 - 19:15 Sun, 28 Sep 2025 23:15:00 +0000 Tyler Durden 1069687 at https://www.zerohedge.com Oklahoma Overrun With Chinese-Operated Marijuana Farms https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/oklahoma-overrun-chinese-operated-marijuana-farms Oklahoma Overrun With Chinese-Operated Marijuana Farms Authored by Nicolas Zifcak via The Epoch Times,

Chinese gangs are taking advantage of loose marijuana rules in Oklahoma to grow and transport marijuana to other states for sale on the black market, authorities say.

Oklahoma narcotics officials told Congress $153 billion worth of marijuana is unaccounted for and likely leaving the state for the black market in other states.

As many as 85 percent of licensed grow sites have connections with Chinese owners or operators, according to Mark Woodward, information officer with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics.

Since 2022, the state has shut down more than 6,000 illegal growing operations. Most U.S. states have made marijuana legally available, but taxes and regulations have pushed up its price, leaving an opening for black market sales.

Donnie Anderson, director of the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics, said at a press conference in March 2025 that his department was conducting raids on illegal marijuana operations every day.

Here’s what we know about the ongoing crisis.

Black Market Operations Flourish
Oklahoma approved medical marijuana in 2018, licensing its cultivation and sale within the state. The state then reported an explosive growth of growers as the law established no cap on the number of farms that could be licensed to grow marijuana and no limit on how many marijuana plants each farm could cultivate.

The majority of these sites are run by Chinese nationals, according to the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics.

By the end of 2022, Oklahoma had 8,400 farms licensed for growing marijuana. The state stopped issuing new licenses in 2022. As of mid-2025, there are under 2,000 licensed farms, which is still more than enough to meet the needs of the 325,000 patients licensed to use marijuana for medical purposes.

As the state has increased the reporting required of the licensed growers, it has come to light that an enormous amount of marijuana is not accounted for.

Between March 2024 and March 2025, medical marijuana dispensaries sold 1.7 million pounds of marijuana in Oklahoma, according to Anderson, director of the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics. But farms licensed to grow marijuana reported growing 87 million plants of marijuana, with a typical yield of one pound per plant.

Anderson told Congress on Sept. 18, 2025, that the marijuana produced by 85 million plants is unaccounted for. That amount is worth around $153 billion, according to state estimates. It is unknown where all the unaccounted product went.

Locals Recruited as Straw Owners
The Oklahoma law, passed in 2018, prohibits marijuana grown in the state from being transported to other states.

Enforcing that law is a challenge. Oklahoma is at the intersection of North-South and East-West interstate highways. In addition, to obtain a license, growers must have two years of residency in the state. Anderson told Congress that some out-of-state operators paid local “straw owners” to fraudulently obtain an Oklahoma license.

These operations are growing marijuana in Oklahoma and transporting the drug to other states for sale. And in one case, one Oklahoma man was registered as owning 300 farms, said Anderson.

The vast majority of these grow sites have a Chinese connection. According to Woodward, currently there are 1,995 active farms in the state, and 85 percent are Chinese-operated or owned.

Several recent convictions of Chinese operators in Oklahoma show the connection between Oklahoma marijuana cultivation and East Coast Chinese criminal organizations.

One case from December 2024 involved Jeff Weng and Tong Lin, who were convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Weng operated out of Brooklyn, New York, while Tong Lin oversaw the grow operation in Wetumka, Oklahoma. According to witness testimony, they transported more than 56,000 pounds of marijuana out of Oklahoma over seven months.

Rising Crime and China Connection
Along with Chinese gangs operating in the state has come an increase in money laundering, illegal gambling, human trafficking, sex trafficking, as well as theft of water and electricity, according to authorities.

Anderson testified to Congress about the rise in crime, specifically the murder of four Chinese nationals in 2022 at an illegal marijuana farm. More murders took place in 2024 and 2025 at marijuana grow sites.

Local officials are concerned about not only the harm to communities, but also the involvement of an unfriendly foreign power. In his testimony in Congress, Anderson highlighted the threat to national security, noting that many grow sites are located near critical infrastructure, including military bases such as the McAlester ammunition facility, which serves as a national stockpile.

In their investigations, the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics has documented transfers to the Bank of China as well as connections to Chinese regime-owned businesses.

Anderson said the state can’t solve this problem by arresting bad actors. He is looking for state and federal officials to take action.

Currently, Oklahoma has 325,000 patients with a medical need for marijuana. Anderson is calling for the state to right-size the production of marijuana to match the need.

It is largely a 'day after' plan which envisions how the Strip will be governed in the future.

The plan appears to encourage Palestinian civilians to remain there, but under a new deradicalized "terror-free zone" and administration. This is the apparent deal currently on the table, and many of its specific aspects are likely to be rejected by one side or the other. 

Via Associated Press For example, Hamas has made clear that it won't negotiate its own demise, while also wanting a full Israeli military withdrawal before all remaining hostages are released, but Prime Minister Netanyahu is still pledging to not end IDF operations until the complete eradication of Hamas is realized.

Some aspects of the plan, including a future Gaza International Transition Authority (GITA) were already revealed days ago, but the below is the first time each of the twenty-one points have been spelled out in a draft which has been made public. There's also this significant development, which seems incredibly optimistic given the current raging state of the battlefield: 

WASHINGTON POST: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO END GAZA WAR WITH IMMEDIATE HALT TO ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS
Notably, it seems a far cry from what Trump was pushing during the opening months of his administration, which included no 'right of return' for Palestinians in Gaza, as well as touting a real estate development for the future, dubbed by some officials a "Riviera of the Middle East". 

Also notable is that the Witkoff-overseen proposal envisions that all Israeli hostages would be released in first 48 hours, and so it clearly has an ambitious vision, despite the fact that the Israeli and Hamas sides are not even talking at the moment, in the wake of this month's Israeli Doha attack.

Revealed: The 21-Point Plan

The following are the contents of the plan, which have been paraphrased by The Times of Israel at the request of its confidential sources:

1. Gaza will be a de-radicalized, terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.

2. Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of its people.

3. If Israel and Hamas agree to the proposal, the war will immediately end, with the IDF halting all operations and gradually withdrawing from the Strip.

4. Within 48 hours of Israel publicly accepting the deal, all living and deceased hostages will be returned.

5. Once the hostages are returned, Israel will free several hundred Palestinian security prisoners serving life sentences and over 1,000 Gazans arrested since the start of the war, along with the bodies of several hundred Palestinians.

6. Once the hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence will be granted amnesty, while members who wish to leave the Strip will be granted safe passage to receiving countries.

7. Once this agreement is reached, aid will surge into the Strip at rates no lower than the benchmarks set in the January 2025 hostage deal, which included 600 trucks of aid per day, along with the rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and the entry of equipment for removing rubble.

8. Aid will be distributed — without interference from either side — by the United Nations and the Red Crescent, along with other international organizations not associated with either Israel or Hamas.

9. Gaza will be administered by a temporary, transitional government of Palestinian technocrats who will be responsible for providing day-to-day services for the people of the Strip. The committee will be supervised by a new international body established by the US in consultation with Arab and European partners. It will establish a framework for funding the redevelopment of Gaza until the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program.

10. An economic plan will be created to rebuild Gaza through the convening of experts with experience in constructing modern Middle East cities and through the consideration of existing plans aimed at attracting investments and creating jobs.

11. An economic zone will be established, with reduced tariffs and access rates to be negotiated by participating countries.

12. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, but those who choose to leave will be allowed to return. Moreover, Gazans will be encouraged to remain in the Strip and offered an opportunity to build a better future there.

13. Hamas will have no role in Gaza’s governance whatsoever. There will be a commitment to destroy and stop building any offensive military infrastructure, including tunnels. Gaza’s new leaders will commit to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.

14. A security guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas and other Gaza factions comply with their obligations and that Gaza ceases to pose a threat to Israel or its own people.

15. The US will work with Arab and other international partners to develop a temporary international stabilization force that will immediately deploy in Gaza to oversee security in the Strip. The force will develop and train a Palestinian police force, which will serve as a long-term internal security body.

16. Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza, and the IDF will gradually hand over territory it currently occupies, as the replacement security forces establish control and stability in the Strip.

17. If Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above points will proceed in terror-free areas, which the IDF will gradually hand over to the international stabilization force.

18. Israel agrees not to carry out future strikes in Qatar. The US and the international community acknowledge Doha’s important mediating role in the Gaza conflict.

19. A process will be established to de-radicalize the population. This will include an interfaith dialogue aimed at changing mindsets and narratives in Israel and Gaza.

20. When Gaza’s redevelopment has been advanced and the PA reform program has been implemented, the conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian statehood, which is recognized as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.

21. The US will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful coexistence.

Beijing's pivot to Brazilian ag suppliers has left Midwest farmers in the nation's top ag belts fearing a spiral into financial hardship.

At the White House on Thursday, President Trump told reporters, "We're going to take some of that tariff money that we've made, we're going to give it to our farmers, who are - for a little while - going to be hurt until it kicks in, the tariffs kick in to their benefit." 

Trump later told reporters that he has not decided on a final version of the plan and would consult with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on the matter. 

China's abrupt pivot to Brazil, after decades of purchasing more than half of the U.S.'s soybeans annually, highlights elevated trade tensions this year as both superpowers attempt to find common ground on a new deal. 

Financial Times noted, "For decades, more than half of all U.S. soybeans went to China, the world's biggest buyer. But this year, as trade talks between Washington and Beijing stall, not a single American soybean has headed east, leaving farmers struggling to stay afloat as bins fill and prices sag while China turns to record supplies from Brazil." 

Source: Financial Times 
U.S. farmers across the Midwest's ag belts largely voted for Trump in 2024 and in other previous elections. The problem for the administration is that export markets for some crops are quickly drying up amid this year's trade war with China and other countries. This has created a potential political vulnerability for the "America First" party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, prompting the administration to consider using tariff revenue to mitigate the financial impact on U.S. farmers.

Rollins recently announced a $10 billion, four-year commitment from Taiwan to offset some of the losses incurred from China. She called this a "game-changer for our farmers & ranchers. America's producers are BACK on offense & leading the world again!" 

🚨 BREAKING TRADE WIN: Taiwan just committed to $10 BILLION in US agriculture buys over the next 4 years, including soybeans, corn, wheat & beef. 🌾🥩

That’s a game-changer for our farmers & ranchers. America’s producers are BACK on offense & leading the world again! 🇺🇸💪
— Secretary Brooke Rollins (@SecRollins) September 19, 2025
The rejiggering of global supply chains to align with "America First" policies has meant more government planning and less voluntary action in the marketplace. Perhaps this will change.

Henry David Thoreau was one of America’s most eloquent and incisive philosophers. His derision of unjust laws in his essay on "Civil Disobedience" is still catnip 175 years later. His summons to individuals to march to the beat of their own drum is a message that will continue to resonate as long as drums and dissonance exist. Thoreau vividly debunked the folly of people squandering their lives stockpiling unnecessary possessions.

But in his final years, Thoreau mutated into an apologist for bloodthirsty fanaticism and helped foment the American Civil War. Thoreau’s derision of prosperity and of freedom of contract continue to animate anti-capitalist zealots in our time. When Thoreau presumed he was rising above mere economic considerations, he was paving the road to serfdom.

Thoreau's best-known work is Walden—his chronicle of living by a Massachusetts pond for a couple years. In the book’s peak piety passage, Thoreau declared, "None can be an impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary poverty." But Thoreau’s poverty was a kabuki performance. His cabin was a mere 20 minutes away from his mother’s dinner table, where he often took repast.

Wiki Commons In the years before the Civil War, Thoreau was almost alone in howling that affluence was damning America. Thoreau bewailed that people were being “ruined by luxury and heedless expense” and proclaimed that the “only cure… is in a rigid economy, a stern and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose.”

Thoreau’s definition of “heedless expense” apparently included anyone not living in a ramshackle cabin like his at Walden. In the 1840s, the average house in the United States had about 1000 square feet and was occupied by 5.5 people, according to the Census Bureau. People had no indoor plumbing, refrigerators, central heating, or electricity. Did Thoreau believe that Americans would be loftier souls if those 5.5 people were squeezed into 550 square feet instead of a thousand square feet of living space? “Ruined by luxury” was not the reason why the average life expectancy in Massachusetts in the 1840s was 38 years.

Thoreau whooped up minimalism as the one true liberation. “With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meager life than the poor,” he declared in Walden. Barely 20 miles from his cabin, Boston was being deluged by haggard souls fleeing a famine that killed 10 percent of the population of Ireland. Refugees arrived on “coffin ships” with a stratospheric death rate and squeezed into ramshackle tenements, plagued by outbreaks of typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis.

Food was sparse and diets were rarely healthy, helping spur a far higher mortality rate among Irish immigrants than other city residents. Thoreau disdained the Irish for their “coarse” and “brutish” ways. Thoreau scoffed that “often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and gross. It is partly his taste, and not merely his misfortune.” My ancestors fled Ireland’s infamous potato famine and arrived in America while Thoreau was at Walden. 

Thoreau’s Original Sin is his contempt for voluntary exchange among private citizens. Thoreau proclaimed that “trade curses everything it handles.” Thoreau talked as if there was a spiritual calculus that made society poorer every time that two parties made a mutually profitable agreement.

Except, of course, when Thoreau was the one profiting. Thoreau boasted that he grew seven miles of rows of beans at Walden. His memoir would have been more candid if he added a postscript to his jeremiad: “Trade is a great evil and… hey buddy, ya wanna buy some beans?” Thoreau sold his surplus beans and bought rice, pork, molasses, apples, and farming supplies. Do people lose part of their soul when they swap beans for bacon or what?

Thoreau proclaimed that “trade curses everything it handles; and though you trade in messages from heaven, the whole curse of trade attaches to the business.” Except when you get a really good price for your “messages from heaven.” Thoreau had the best volunteer literary agent in America—New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley—whom Thoreau met when he was briefly tutoring on Staten Island. Greeley arranged to sell one of Thoreau’s essays for $75 in 1849. This was more than double what Thoreau spent to build his house at Walden—$28.12—and more than 8 times as much as Thoreau’s profit from growing beans—$8.71. (The only way that Thoreau showed a profit from those beans was presuming that his own labor was worthless.) That $75 in 1849 would be roughly $2500 in current dollars, excellent pay nowadays for an essay for 99 percent of aspiring writers. Thoreau paused his principles long enough to cash the check. Greeley wanted to sell more such pieces but Thoreau preferred to devote himself to writing books instead of articles.

Thoreau’s disdain for voluntary exchanges is dicey to reconcile with how he survived selling his own talents. He declared in Walden, “For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the most independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty days in a year to support one.” Thoreau—whose townsmen recognized as a Harvard University graduate—wasn’t hiring himself out to dig ditches. His primary income in his thirties and early forties came from his work as a surveyor that paid double or triple the wage received by unskilled labor. By developing a well-paid talent, Thoreau earned enough working part time to help pay to publish his first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849).

Thoreau thrived before surveyors were compelled to get prior approval from officialdom. Entry into almost a third of all occupations is now restricted by government licensing. Government regulations have spurred credentialist mania that make it more difficult to thrive without a college degree. Government restrictions and mandates have imposed far more barriers to independent living than most Thoreau fans recognize.

Thoreau—like other Transcendentalists—had a weakness for moral absolutes that could quickly spiral into drivel. Thoreau castigated railroads and declared that “the swiftest traveler is he that goes afoot.” A day’s wages at that point was 90 cents—which was the same fare for 30 miles rail travel. Thoreau said it would be faster to simply walk that distance rather than do a day’s work and then pay to ride the railroad. Thoreau proclaimed this as “the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with regard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as long.”

Thoreau neglected to include the expiration date for his “universal law.” Thoreau’s “rebuttal” of rail travel was practically out of date by the time Walden was printed 8 years after he left the pond. Rail travel had plunged in price by the end of the century, with some routes costing only a penny a mile for non-first-class passengers. At the same time, wages for unskilled laborers in Massachusetts more than tripled during the 1800s.

Thoreau railed against railroads in part because they were binding together broader swaths of humanity than local towns and villages. Thoreau preferred to keep localities relatively isolated and untainted by humanity beyond the county line. Thoreau rhapsodized about growing beans but the farmland in his part of Massachusetts was far less productive than farmland in Ohio and Indiana. Thoreau fretted about the new competition that local farmers faced but ignored how soaring agricultural productivity could greatly reduce the percentage of people toiling on the land to feed themselves and their families.

Thoreau was able to conduct his “experiment in living” because his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson had recently bought a 14-acre patch of land by that pond. Emerson could afford to buy that parcel in part thanks to the profits from his essay “Self-Reliance,” published a few years earlier. Emerson allowed Thoreau to temporarily live on that land in return for clearing some of the briars and trees.

Private land ownership was the prerequisite of Thoreau’s independent living. What would have happened if Thoreau had tried to do the same thing on land owned by the National Park Service (which was not created until 1916)? The authorities might have viewed him as a squatter and burned down his cabin including all his books and manuscripts in progress while he was out fishing.

While Thoreau portrays private possessions as burdens to self-liberation, earlier Americans recognized property as a bulwark of freedom. In the 18th century, property was equated with “liberty because property secured independence. Material goods were valued less for their market worth, as a means of economic development, or as a capital resource, than as a guarantee of individual autonomy,” as law professor John Phillip Reid noted in his classic work, The Concept of Liberty in the Age of the American Revolution. Such autonomy allows people to follow their own values or seek to build their own destiny. Hungarian economist Janos Kornai—a courageous dissident in the Soviet Bloc—observed in 1981: “The further elimination of private ownership is taken, the more consistently can full subjection be imposed.” Perhaps that is why so many environmentalists and leftists nowadays want to destroy private property.

We can appreciate Thoreau’s brilliance while rejecting his follies. It is possible to avoid deifying possessions without glorifying poverty. Seeking to “rise above economics” too often merely unleashes politicians to drag nations to their ruin.

Roberts competed as an Olympic athlete and distance runner for Guyana 25 years ago, but this apparently didn't help him escape immigration enforcement and his active warrants.

At the time of his arrest, Roberts was working as the Superintendent despite being an illegal alien with a final order of removal and no work authorization. He was caught with a firearm in his possession (which is illegal to carry for a non-citizen), as well as a hunting knife and $3000 cash. Roberts had previous warrants for weapons possession charges in February of 2020. 

Democrats claim that these ICE arrests and Trump's deportation policies are directly to blame for the now numerous shootings committed by leftist activists. In other words, conservatives who are enforcing constitutional immigration laws are to blame when leftists try to kill them.

During a targeted enforcement operation on Sept. 26, 2025, officers approached Roberts in his vehicle after identifying himself, but he sped away. Officers later discovered his vehicle abandoned near a wooded area. State Patrol assisted in locating the subject and he was taken into ICE custody.

"This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement," said ICE ERO St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson. "This should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats. How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district."

The arrest spurred a protest outside the federal courthouse in Des Moines.

In response to the arrest, protesters mobilized under what appears to be the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a radical leftist group linked to the Los Angeles riots and connected to Neville Roy Singham, a U.S. billionaire with reported ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and to extremist organizations that fuel division and civil chaos nationwide.

Video and images show professionally produced "Free Roberts" signs with PSL symbols, indicating the protest was likely artificial rather than organic. The activity aligns with the broader protest-industrial complex and appears linked to dark-money NGO networks backed by Singham.

Surprise, surprise.

Civil terrorism expert Jason Curtis Anderson of One City Rising comments on the story and provides readers with additional context about PSL's protest involvement:

The Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) is a core component of the Neville Roy Singham operation. Their #1 goal is to exploit the fault lines in our society, destabilizing the existing system, and induce the American population into supporting communism. 

The PSL is their political party, which runs people for office, and last year, ran Claudia De La Cruz for President, getting her on the ballot in 19 states. The PSL played a lead role in the nationwide campus encampments, but the wider Singham network also has their own network of educators. They are capturing the universities from the top down and bottom up. 

The PSL protesting on behalf of armed conman (and alleged illegal alien) Ian Roberts serves all of their agendas: 

It shows solidarity with people of color

It shows solidarity with illegal immigrants 

It attacks ICE (The most violent anti-ICE riots were in California and Texas, both led by the PSL) 

It gives them an excuse to create more social division and bloviate about how this is a fascist country 

Nobody in America should want a foreign national who was arrested with a loaded gun and $3k in cash around their kids. But for the PSL and the wider Singham network, they don't want America to abide by laws, especially as it pertains to immigration. This event marked a new enforcement in this sector. A chess piece was taken off of the board, and they are angry about it. Capturing education is a huge part of Singham's strategy, and while Ian Roberts was not 'in network' just yet, the Singham network has already made significant progress on developing a "network of educators" to help them carry out their goals. 

The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners issued Roberts a license to serve as Superintendent in the state in July 2023, according to Norris.

"There is new information that has been made public that we did not know, and we have not been able to verify," Norris said.

Roberts entered the US on a student visa in 1999, on which he overstayed. He had no work order and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024 (under Joe Biden), according to the DHS statement. Des Moines public school officials claim they were not aware of the order of removal. The leftist sentiments and calls for "radical empathy" from those same officials suggest, however, that they were likely aware of his immigration status and hired him anyway.

Not surprising...
I found this bio on the British Amazon for Dr Ian Roberts, from around 2011.

What it shows is that Roberts' career was that of an itinerant charter school principal in rough urban school districts. Very few of these schools got "turned around." Many have since closed. pic.twitter.com/RjmFsIYa5c

The arrest highlights the dark cloud of far-left ideology plaguing the U.S. school system and the unfortunate reality that many district officials enable the spread of woke propaganda in American education. It also underscores the Democrats’ doubling down on ignorance, showing more sympathy for criminals than for innocent citizens. Moreover, the arrest and subsequent protest mobilization reveal how Democrats and their radical leftist dark-money NGO networks mobilize force whenever their power is threatened, especially when one of their own is removed from a position of authority within Des Moines public schools. Remember: indoctrination and nation-killing policies often begin in classrooms - and Democrats used an illegal alien to spread toxic woke.

Meandering Through the Narratives
Today, we will briefly run through the narratives that are driving markets and shaping the economy. We had the opportunity to discuss many of these during the first ½ hour of Bloomberg Surveillance on Wednesday morning.

Academy also published our monthly Around the World Podcast (also on iTunes and Spotify), focused on a range of key geopolitical issues facing us all. This dovetailed well with the “print edition” of Around the World with Academy Securities.

The i-Shaped Economy
We had some interesting discussions around last weekend’s What Shape is the Economy? There seems to be agreement that “little i” represents the fact that a small segment of the population is doing extremely well, which isn’t reflected in either the K or k-shaped economy that so many people like to use. There is more debate on how “the stick” in the i is doing. We argued that basically it is okay, but got some pushback that those outside of the elite circle are struggling. Concern about jobs (not actual job losses, but concern about job losses) came up frequently as did indications that the consumer, at all levels, is stretched (delinquencies for lower income consumers, and “trading down” for even higher income consumers). The arguments against the vast majority doing well were reasonably compelling, but for now, I’m still in the “most people are okay to good with a few doing extremely well” camp.

Ra-Ra-RasPUTIN
Academy’s Geopolitical Intelligence Group weighed in on Russia’s Air Space Incursions, in a SITREP and in the podcast mentioned earlier in this report. The President urged for NATO members to take a tough stance on such incursions during the United Nations General Assembly.

This certainly adds a new dimension to the war in Europe, but what I am most interested in, is that “suddenly” everyone is discussing the possibility of Europe taking Russia’s frozen reserves, and using the money to fund the war effort and their military spending. We advocated for this possibility two weeks ago in Ra-Ra-RasPUTIN and believe that this is the most important development in the war. More important even than Russia’s air space violations. Why? Because Russia is expecting these reserves to be returned (presumably, some may be spoken for by those countries that supply Russia with military equipment or components that Russia is using), so not getting them will hurt. At the same time, using that money to buy weapons (primarily from American suppliers) for the Ukrainians puts pressure on Putin in the battlefield.

The situation could get worse before it gets better, but even the threat of confiscating the reserves as some form of war reparations is a massive step in forcing Putin to reconsider his current stance of “business as usual” in Ukraine.

Peace Through Strength
A flurry of stories hit the tape on Thursday that the Secretary of War was calling a large number of senior flag officers (1-star and above Generals and Admirals, from the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) to Virginia for some meetings.

There is little (or no) information on what is going to be discussed. General Spider Marks gave his thoughts to the nation on CNN yesterday. There has been some reporting that this is preparing the military for some personnel changes, in the event of a Government Shutdown.

I am lucky enough to be in D.C. on Monday and Tuesday next week (ahead of our annual Geopolitical Summit in Annapolis) and hope to get some more color.

My thoughts are more along the lines of this is a “rebranding onsite.”

The department (via executive order) has been changed from the Department of Defense to the Department of War. That certainly conveys a different message.
We have launched successful (and unprecedented) strikes against the main Iranian Nuclear Facilities and Struck Drug Vessels from Venezuela. Both of these acts go beyond just having a more aggressive posture and actually demonstrated the willingness to use our military capabilities. We have argued that going back as far as the attack on Soleimani, deterrence is only truly effective if your adversaries believe you will use your capabilities.
Hegseth has been vocal about cultivating a “warrior ethos” mentality and may want to make sure that his vision is thoroughly understood and supported.
More nuanced, but fitting with the theme, has been a push to be less restrictive on rules of engagement. Some messaging to senior officers from all branches of service would be consistent with that.
My expectation is that we will see steps taken to make deterrence more effective and to more thoroughly re-establish Peace through Strength.

My speculation on the goals of the meeting could be wrong, but all of our GIG members involved have cited re-establishing Peace through Strength as a priority for this administration. It is also a crucial step towards being able to reduce spending while maintaining global order.

The “Mythical” Neutral Rate
I was somewhat surprised, pleasantly, that new Fed board member used his first public speaking opportunity to argue that the so-called “neutral rate” is lower than the Fed previously thought, warranting significant rate cuts even in a stable economy.

My “enjoyment” from this topic was primarily due to watching any number of people defend Fed policy, by arguing that no one really knows what the neutral rate is, and that it changes anyways.

You cannot know the neutral rate because no one knows the neutral rate.
Therefore, current policy is correct.
I suspect that this rather “wonky” discussion will help pave the way for a more “brute force” push to cut rates faster than the market is pricing in.

Look for lower yields (after the recent rise) and yield curves to continue to flatten (2s / 30s hit their lowest level since early August last week).

ProSec™
Production for Security is finally catching on, at least as a political agenda and investment thesis, even if the phrase hasn’t gained popularity.

There are a number of stocks that have run up, following the leads of:

MP Materials (ticker MP), a “fully integrated” rare earth producer, that saw an investment from the Department of Defense along with some loans provided by large banks.
Intel (INTC), which continues to generate headlines and higher stock prices.
Lithium America (LAC) gapped higher this week surrounding renegotiation of a $2.26 billion Department of Energy loan (as reported by Bloomberg).
We continue to look for companies (many with small market caps) that could be integral in jump-starting the ability to produce and refine things critical to national security (chips, commodities, and even some pharmaceuticals). We also see this investment thesis going global.

It seems that more countries are looking at their vulnerabilities and at least starting to think about ways to produce some core amount of what is necessary on their own.

Having said that, a lot of questions have come up about how this is being done.

In general, I’m supportive of the American taxpayer owning stakes in crucial companies. In some cases, the government is a purchaser of that company’s goods, so taxpayers benefit from their own money being spent.
Grants or subsidies have been used in the past. Those tend to benefit the stakeholders, who are not the U.S. taxpayer. They often have “strings attached” to try to force companies in certain ways for the admin (at the time) to get their policy objectives achieved. That too is fraught with potential issues, as it may create inefficiencies at the company. Maybe it benefits the public well enough, but that is a tricky calculation.
I would like to see rules laid out, and maybe even an oversight board, to monitor the investments and to make it clear what the government is allowed or not allowed to do with/for companies owned. Should it be completely an arm’s length transaction? That would reduce the potential for interference in the marketplace, but does it provide maximum benefit for the taxpayer and the policy initiatives? 
As discussed last weekend, I’d like to have some clarity on rules governing what can and cannot be done. Some effective guidelines need to be in place. Having said that, what I would like (and will advocate for) is not the reality of what we have, and we’d be remiss not to trade and plan for the situation we have.
I’m not sure Graham and Dodd have a chapter for investing in this style of governance, but we need to have one in our own investing and planning playbook.

From Molecules to Electrons
Mike Rodriguez, our head of Sustainable Finance, came to my rescue this week. I’ve been stuck on trying to get people to change the equation from Energy = Oil to Energy = Electricity. He pointed out how old that made me sound, and converted me to discussing the shift from molecules (fuel) to electrons (electricity).

Electricity inflation may be the single most important component of inflation we have ever faced.

With some “minor” inconveniences (depending on where you live and work), you can cut back on gasoline purchases. Do more errands per trip. Carpool (they even have helpful lanes for that). Also, unless you are driving a lot, you are probably going to the gas station once a week at most. So, while it hurts to see gas surge at the pump, it isn’t the end of the world (and I’ve argued for some time, that oil prices going higher are probably more or less neutral for the economy given the number of jobs and average pay, for those in the fossil fuel sector).

Food inflation is awful and painful, but “substitution” is a real thing. You can “trade down” in terms of quality or type of food, to reduce costs. Definitely worse than gas inflation, but it is spread over so many items and happens a little each day, that it seems to get lost, at least a little, in the shuffle.

Electricity is tricky. We can all turn off lights and monitor power (maybe demand that electronic goods don’t all now come with lights that seem to stay on whether you want them on or not, but that is starting a rant we don’t have time for today). To the extent EVs are driving demand, then the same rules laid out above can apply. But refrigeration? How do you control that? Air conditioning? What temperature you live at affects your sleep, which in turn affects everything else in your life (yeah, I’ve been getting converted into a healthy sleep nut). Also, unlike the gas tank, which you watch every time you are in your car, very few of us (I hope almost no one) goes outside and watches how fast the electric meter is turning. It is always kind of a “surprise” when you see the electric bill. How much did I use? What was the cost?

I’ve probably understated the risks of other inflation and overstated the risks of electricity inflation, but I think it is going to become a major issue in upcoming elections.

It took electricity over a decade to rise just over 10% (2009 to 2020). Since then, it has risen closer to 40%! So far, there is no indication that the costs are stabilizing.

The production of electrons may be the most important part of any government’s ProSec™ strategy!

I don’t see any way around using nuclear. While many sustainable energy projects (especially wind) seem to be out of favor with the President, I don’t see how they don’t play a major role in our future. If anything, sustainable, especially solar, provide the quickest way to ramp up electron production.

I could spend months trying to figure out a viable strategy, but sadly, I think all we have to do is look at China and charts of their solar energy production (going vertical) and their nuclear power plant building (they may be building more plants than the rest of the world combined), to know what other countries should be considering.

My portfolio is littered with companies in this sector as not only is it a major growth opportunity in its own right, but I also see plenty of opportunity for ProSec™ to be pushed into action. Again, I’ve been primarily focused on the U.S. but I see thi
